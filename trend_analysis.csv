0,0,(UK) My boyfriend had a depressive episode and now the Uni won't give him his loan.,6,g939z4,Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/Student/comments/g939z4/uk_my_boyfriend_had_a_depressive_episode_and_now/,0,"So my bf is studying at a college with the OU. Back in January he took a lot of time off because he was in a really bad place mentally. He had had constant communication with his tutor about this however at this time he wasn't submitting any work. 

When he was ready to come back to the uni he got papers from the doctor to confirm his diagnosis and treatment (as the uni had asked him to do). He contacted his tutor again who told him everything would be fine he just needed to submit ONE ASSIGNMENT. He then contacted student finance as he had noticed that he hadn't received his loan when he was supposed to. THEY informed him that he was no longer enrolled on a course and he wont be receiving any more payments. The uni had removed him from the course and simply didnt tell him. He contacted his tutor and was told that  if he submitted certain pieces of work that he would be put back on the course and could start receiving finance again.

 To summarise, he was told he needed to submit 1 assignment and that he was still on his course and everything was fine, he was then informed by someone other than the uni that he was in fact removed from the course, his tutor then told him he has to submit 3 assignments to be put back on despite what he had previously said.  My boyfriend did the work he had to do and sent it off. His tutor vanished for 2 weeks and ignored all the emails. During this time my bf was receiving eviction letters as he had missed his rent payment. 

When the tutor finally responded he told my bf that he now has to do more work if he wants to receive his finance. My boyfriend is having to decide between having food or having electricity. I'm helping him out financially and putting myself into debt so he doesn't starve. His family receive very little from the work that do and his mum has 2 other kid to look after. They help when they can. He has been looking for work for the past month or so but he's had no replies. 

This has all caused him to relapse into another depressive episode. He understands that he needs to complete his work to get paid but he's really struggling to get anything done now due to constant hunger and depression. I dont feel like the uni have any right to hold him at ransom like this. He is starving himself and has received more eviction notices. His tutor lied to him about his situation and lied to him about being removed from the course. He also lied about the amount of work he needs to do to get put back on the course. Every time he submits something he has to submit something else to receive his money. He's now missed 2 student fiance payments. Is there any sort of legal action he can take or are the uni within their rights to do this?",1588031528.0

I am an American Citizen studying in an Indian college. The course in that college is pertaining to international standards and encourages us to transfer abroad. They have their set colleges which they have partnered with and want us to tranfter to. But I have other plans. 

I'm trying to get myself into UT austin I have the sufficient grades but the problem for me is the Fafsa loan.

Yes I can apply but my dad earns well over the limit of 50000$ to be eligible. Due to other loans he is still paying off he cant afford to pay for the expensive course at UT austin ( I'll be attempting to transfer after the 2nd year in my college which is when everyone will be doing it in my course ).

I want to go to UT because it has some boxing gyms right there where I can learn and develop my passion in boxing and I have an uncle in dallas. So kinda near by. No i dont have any professional experience in boxing. I do practice in a gym but the facilities in india are too less for me to take it seriously, thats why I want to transfer to UT.I will be trying to apply by october of this year during my 2nd academic year to transfer for the 3rd year at UT.

Any advice on a loan which you guys would recommend and what I should do would be nice.
I am thinking of applying for an academic loan but I still dont know my final first year GPA yet.

I know its complicated and seriously even I am confused about what to do. But any advice would be much appreciated and thank you for reading so far, honestly even I am getting a headache reading all of this XD

Edit: Okay so also I forgot to mention, my dad is super unsupportive of my boxing, so me going to US for a finance degree will help me get an excuse to go to US and train under the facilities and also allow me to have a back up plan for the future. You guys know how asian parents are right?",1555795157.0

One estate agent goes: you need a full time job or we don‚Äôt trust students. What the hell.
We don‚Äôt have a full time job - fair enough but we get a loan which we can use. Plus we do have a stable income of the loan coming in every couple months. It is up to the person to make a payment just like in a full time job. Both parties are binded by a contract. 
We possibly might not pay rent on time - Same thing goes for people with a full time job. I don‚Äôt understand if you‚Äôre giving someone a contract and they don‚Äôt pay... you can take legal action against them for both students and ‚Äònormal working people‚Äô.
They trash the place - first of all you get references which can check what type of tenant you are for both students and normal people. Both parties can trash the place. 

I don‚Äôt get why we are expected to stay in halls or be in a house share. Like hello maybe I want to have a normal flat and normal life. 
Looks like I had a Tesco full time I‚Äôd have a higher chance of getting the flat, instead of making a better future for myself.

&nbsp;

Example: A student needs $10k for a semester (or coding bootcamp). They go to a financier and get $10k upfront structured as debt. If the student doesn't graduate they're required to pay back the principal plus interest as if it were a standard loan. If the student does graduate the principal plus interest converts into an income share agreement where the financier is entitled to X% of the former student's income over a specified period of time.

&nbsp;

It's better than a loan for students because there's no defined principal that they have to pay down if they graduate. It's better than an income share agreement for investors because if the student doesn't graduate the dispersed funds are still treated as a loan.

Matter at Hand: Teaching assistant, Laboratory assistant, PhD students, Instructor(newly graduate or yet to finish) are not happy about their wage.

Data before the strike: TAs earn guaranteed $4000+ per year Ôºàpaycheck mailed every month) for a total of 105 Hours. Whether there is tutorial or not, you get the check.
Lab & PhD & Instructor that I am not familiar, but according to their claim, PhD is earning $15000 per year well below Ontario Poverty line $19000.

My complaint: no one seems to give a s‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about students whose classes and tutorial are cancelled due to the strike. Keep in mind people, students are studying on loans they have to pay back later. Among them, international students are paying $3000 plus per course per semester (roughly $200 a single lecture). An average degree in UoT costs them $120,000. Now they are closing in on finals, who is gonna compensate for the knowledge that is part of their future credentials?

This world is simply getting more absurd every day. If you are not in the system, but an average employee, you are screwed both ways, for no one gives f‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• anymore.

I'm 30years old and moved from Melbourne to Adelaide to start uni in the hopes I could meet people at uni or at work and it wouldn‚Äôt be such a big deal.

That was 2 weeks ago, needless to say, I haven't met anyone really, I haven't started any job and now can't get employment. I don't know anyone in Adelaide and I don‚Äôt have permanent accommodation.

Going back to Melbourne would be my only option as my parents will let me live with them rent free (thanks mumsie).

**The Situation:**

Uni has closed its doors. Everything is online. I'm doing a ***Bachelor of Science*** for context

I'm tossing up whether to stay in Uni or not. Seems pointless as we might not get any contact hours for 4-9 months.

Each subject only runs for 1 Semester, which means the rest of the semester is online AT LEAST but could be the rest of the year. In some degrees that would work fine, but not so much in Science degrees.

**Arguments to stay:**

1. I can't get a job anyway, might as well be student NOW rather than when I can get a job.
2. What else is there to do in a jobless apocalypse.
3. Might still get a degree in 3 years with some knowledge in environmental Science

**Arguments against:**

1. Potentially going a year without lab/prac work
2. Uncertain Future, who knows what's going to happen with HECS(Student loan system in Australia) - I could pull out now an not pay or owe anything
3. Can't get to Library as it will likely close soon, and I will be living in a different State
4. Laptop will soon stop working (2013 HP), I need it now more than ever and can't afford a new one. Can't buy a shit one because It needs to support GIS (large format software)
5. Looking into future job markets or further study might see that all students in Semester one of *Year 1 Apocalypse* would be incompetent due to lack of contact hours and lab work

&#x200B;

**TLDR :** is it worth continuing a Science degree online, instead of in person, for 4-9 months during an apocalypse? That means no practical or Lab work and less hands on experience.

I went to university from the ages 18-21, like a lot of people, and I slowly fell out of love with the course I was on.

I was satisfied with this at the time, but now I kind of wish I could go back and study something else. The thing is, I already had my student loan, did my three years, all paid for and all done.

My siblings agree with my parents because they are all older and had never gone though what I‚Äôm going though and my friends parents actually let them be college students and they moved into a dorm. So I literally have no one else to talk too.
My parents didn‚Äôt let me move into a dorm my freshman year because: I knew no one and my mother said she would just drive me EVERYDAY along with my other sibling. It takes an HOUR and because it‚Äôs fall it rains everyday- it takes an HOUR & 20 minutes to drive to college and come back. My mom said she would just drive me. How am I going to study,  work or have a social life?

I have an on campus job and it‚Äôs so hard because I have to ask my parents AND my siblings about their schedules to make my work AND class schedule. 
So far I‚Äôve made friends but because I don‚Äôt live in a dorm it‚Äôs hard to really make an actual friend group bc I can‚Äôt hang out whenever. The other day I was invited somewhere but, my mother called me and said she was already waiting for me & I had to go home. I thought I would get over it. 

I thought everyday I would be happier living at home but everyday when they pick me up, I see everyone walking to their dorms with friends and I get kinda sad. For freshman they have a two week long thing and it‚Äôs supposed to be for freshman to meet other freshmen BUT, because I don‚Äôt live on campus I can‚Äôt really go.

I know what you are probably thinking: I‚Äôm ungrateful. 

First, thanks for looking out for my parents but, also try to put yourself in my position:
-it takes 1.20 minutes of commute to and from = 1 hr & 40 minutes‚Äî not counting the times I might spend waiting for my sibling to also get out of work so: 2 HOURS EVERYDAY. TWO.

-yes, I‚Äôve tried to talk to my parents especially my mom. But, she gets mad and sad and she says I hate her and all I want to do is get away from her and then she says I‚Äôll miss her when she‚Äôs dead and how I should be grateful for having a caring mom who wants to help.

-social life? I had my parents pick me up and drive me places in hs but no one does that in college

-STUDYING! My room is across from my parents room. Like literally 2 feet away. My mom doesn‚Äôt go to sleep until she can‚Äôt stay up anymore. During hs it was hard doing homework, studying bc she would check in every now and then and say to go to sleep. I have always wanted to study at night BUT, I couldn‚Äôt bc my mom would yell at me and ask why I couldn‚Äôt do that earlier

-my parents are kinda really strict

-my mom thinks she‚Äôs helping but she‚Äôs not! She‚Äôs making it more annoying and harder than it has to be by offering to be a driver.

- The loans would be in my name if i needed them to help pay for my dorm. And, yeah; living at home means I wouldn‚Äôt have debt but, everyone does it and they are fine.

YALL. So let me start off by saying: is a private (Jesuit) uni even worth it?

I don‚Äôt have a vast financial base, I‚Äôm not religious, and I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my damn time. 

Im a 19y female, first semester sophomore at a private Jesuit university in the Midwest. My school is known for ‚Äúbreeding medical students‚Äù and so i came into college with that being my intent on future career choices. I bet you could guess where if you really tried. 

However, now I‚Äôm majoring in Business Intelligence & Analytics (BIA) and Economics.

Let me just say: I‚Äôm fucking MISERABLE here. I tried all of the Greek life sorority shit (cause that‚Äôs the only way you can have a social life here with only 1000 students per graduating class), and I still don‚Äôt have a social life. It seems that everyone‚Äôs priorities are in a different place than mine. I feel this weird social pressure and frankly I feel extremely out of place. I don‚Äôt have many friends but rather a few acquaintances. I work off campus (which is surprisingly rare here) every weekend, don‚Äôt care what i look like going to class, and don‚Äôt care about the extensive CORE classes i have to take that revolve around ‚Äúmaking you a better person through religion.‚Äù 

I just hate it and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I‚Äôm looking at give or take ~50-60k in student loans once I graduate. 

Strengths:
Understanding big picture concepts, talking to people, numbers, working hard

My ultimate goal: 
focus on internships rn, right out of college enroll at Northwestern Uni to receive my MBA. I would say I‚Äôm pretty smart‚Äîmy GPA is not the best from all my pre-med classes (3.0) but overall I‚Äôm a pretty high-achieving individual I would say. 

So........what should I do? Am I losing opportunity if I transfer to a state school/online schooling and work full time? Will that lessen my chances of getting into Northwestern? Is it worth it to stay at a school for two more years where I‚Äôm miserable at and rack up all this debt?

***Wasted spending makes college less affordable for Idaho students***

Boise State University funds separate graduation celebrations by race and sexual orientation, an example of its purported diversity and inclusion. Some state lawmakers are not fans.

Twenty-eight House Republicans asked the taxpayer-funded institution to ditch ‚Äúdivisive and exclusionary‚Äù programs such as ‚ÄúBlack Graduation‚Äù and ‚ÄúRainbow Graduation‚Äù that separate and segregate students, the [***Idaho Statesman***](https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/local/education/boise-state-university/article232600507.html) reports.

They want to strike while the presidential iron is hot. Marlene Tromp [**joined the university July 1**](https://www.boisestate.edu/news/2019/04/23/marlene-tromp-named-boise-state-president/) from the University of California-Santa Cruz, where she served as provost, following the interim appointment of Martin Schimpf for the prior academic year.

The lawmakers take issue with multiple Boise State programs that treat students differently based on their race, ethnicity or ‚Äúunderrepresented‚Äù status at the university. They mention graduate fellowships and a grad school prep course for underrepresented minorities, as well as financial support for multicultural student events such as the black and LGBT graduation celebrations.

‚ÄúThese initiatives by nature highlight differences and suggest that certain groups are treated unequally now ‚Äî and that BSU should redress these grievances,‚Äù Rep. Barbara Ehardt wrote for the lawmakers last week. The letter was also signed by more than half of the¬†House Education Committee membership.

**MORE**: [**Report finds nearly 200 colleges encourage, facilitate racial segregation**](https://www.thecollegefix.com/nearly-200-universities-encourage-facilitate-segregation-among-students-of-color-report/)

It was prompted by Schimpf‚Äôs June 4 newsletter that championed ‚Äúinclusive excellence‚Äù over ‚Äúacademic excellence,‚Äù which was ‚Äúdisconcerting‚Äù because its priorities did not ‚Äúreflect Idaho values,‚Äù Ehardt wrote in the letter, which was shared by [***Idaho Ed News***](https://www.idahoednews.org/news/students-stand-with-inclusive-programs-at-boise-state/). (The *Statesman* did not post it despite being the [**largest newspaper**](https://www.agilitypr.com/resources/top-media-outlets/top-10-idaho-daily-newspapers-by-circulation/) in Idaho.)

In addition, Republican lawmakers object to the usurpation of police by a ‚Äúgender-based violence community-coordinated response team,‚Äù spending ‚Äúvaluable time assessing the proper use of names and pronouns versus educational pursuits that lead to a career,‚Äù¬†and implicit-bias considerations in hiring for the search committee curricula.

They portrayed the spending on these diversity and inclusion programs as an impediment to affordability for Idaho students. Other questionable uses of taxpayer money: promoting scholarships to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals students (‚Äúthe state turned down 1,780 Idaho applicants in 2018‚Äù), new diversity-focused administrative positions, and special advertising budgets for departments to draw in a less white and male pool of candidates.

Ehardt seemed especially miffed about mandatory redistribution among Boise State students. She criticized a program that forces them to ‚Äúfinancially support the food pantry, housing, emergency loans to students, and more‚Äîeven as they struggle to pay for their own tuition!‚Äù

Tromp ignored the specific programs and proposals highlighted by the lawmakers‚Äô letter. Instead, she told the *Statesman* she looked forward to hearing Ehardt‚Äôs ‚Äúconcerns and ideas‚Äù in person ‚Äúand to talking with her and others about Boise State‚Äôs mission to serve all students.‚Äù

Hello guys, this is my first post here and I wanted to ask your advice. I am considering applying to a master's program at the University of Utrecht, called ""New media&digital culture"".

Firstly, I was wondering if some of you maybe followed this program and can offer me an insight or any kind of advice. I have a bachelor's degree in Public Relations and Communication.

Secondly, I have been informing myself of the student financiering loan, I have read a bunch of articles on the web about it. The thing is, if I am to come, I will probably have to stay with a friend in Enschede, as I do not know anyone in Utrecht and I would not rush myself to live alone as I know it can get kind of harsh and it is a new thing to me. I will have to get a job to support myself right away, and I understand that the loan comes to effect after 3 months of working those 56h per month. I'm hoping to have an estimative budget of \~2000 euros by then + the monthly salary until the loan comes in. Do you think it is manageable, considering the train trips to Utrecht for uni which can be kind of costly.

How optimistic should I be for getting a job pretty quick after getting there. Should I start looking before going, maybe get an interview on skype?

Also, from your experience, concerning the tuition fee, does it have to be paid in full once the academic year starts or it is a monthly payment scheme? Can I pay it every three months or something like this, a bigger sum at a given period of time. I can't seem to find this info anywhere.

I went to school for a bit while he didn't because he had to upgrade courses due to missing most of grade 12 due to depression and such. He really wants to go to school, but he doesn't know what he wants to study. His home life isn't the best. His mom basically shuts him out and is angry at him without any apparent reason and his dad and sister are just sort of there and not doing anything. The only job he's ever had is working for his dad under the table, paid in cash every few weeks, and although it's good money he can't get student loans because he's never had any official employment. His home life with his family has gotten worse and it's harder and harder for him to stay there. Because if he moves out he won't have a way to get to work. He's gotten extremely depressed because of this situation and he can't see a way other than working full time, living on his own and going to school and basically not having a life. I've tried helping him and reassuring him it's going to be okay. But there's only so much I can do. I asked if he would be willing to see a counselor or something and he said maybe. Could he perhaps see a career counselor of some sort at a university to figure out what direction he'd want to go in, while working full time at a legit job? I want to help but I don't want to sound like a broken record.

Every time I ask anybody about it they tell me to give up why should I give up to pursue my dreams just because of the ""fate"" that started the game for me in hard difficulty I know it looks pitying to say all this because it is. 

Details: you might ask what is my budget or do you work and such so here it is, 

I don't work because it's not permitted for anyone below the age of 21 here to work of course I'm going to work if get into the university to ease financing for me , I don't have a budget because my parents aren't willing to help me in my studies. 

I searched for a loan that could be paid after graduation and I found this [http://www.festo-bildungsfonds.de] but as it needs a German guarantor and I don't have any I checked it out, if you know any loans that are based on income sharing agreement like this one I could get please do tell. Any other details that you might want to know about comment it and I will give it to you thanks for understanding.

Edit:

This is the offer letter [http://imgur.com/Dnbwui5] my problem is that because I got my high school diploma in dubai it means it's not equivalent to the Dutch high school diploma that's why they asked me to take a 1 year foundation course. 

The university itself have great financial aid but the organization I was referred to by the university to get my foundation year does not have any financial aid so I'm stuck and can't get to the university because of that, I tried to get a loan but I cant because I'm still not 21 and my parents won't help me with payment as they are opposing the idea. 

There is this income sharing agreement that I posted in the text here it's very cool as they pay for your tuition and give you monthly payment for your living costs but after you graduate and start working you will have to pay them back from a pre fixed percentage of your salary.

Apparently, there are very specific qualifications to being independent, and she does not qualify. The closest she comes is that in special situations, if she provided three documentations of their abuse, they may be able to help.

**My questions are as follows**:

1. Is it unlikely that she would get approved for loans at this point? Would it help to find an adult with good credit score to co-sign the loan?
2. What constitutes proof of abuse? Would we be forced into a legal battle against her parents if we persist?
3. Is there any feasible way for her to cut off her parents **and** finish her final year, or do we need to choose what is more important?

I was born and raised in the U.S, and therefore am a U.S citizen, though my parents are Mexican. When we moved back to Mexico a couple years ago, my father found a job as a professor at ""Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey"" and I've already been accepted with a 90% scholarship, so I'm fortunate enough to have a fallback option in case everything goes wrong. Though ""Tec"" is a great university, they do not have the major I've been passionate about since I was in middle school: computer science, so I applied to a couple colleges in the U.S and was admitted at Penn State, albeit with no scholarship and I'll be charged out-of-state tuition. I applied for the FAFSA and have been given 11,000$ in aid for attendance. However, I still must pay 35,000$ somehow. Since my parents do not have that kind of money, my only option is taking out student loans. This is where the complication arises. I have no problem whatsoever with getting into debt because I'm sure I'll be able to pay it back. Added to that, I'll be working part time and will most likely land internships starting my first year since I already know how to code, so after the first year the economic burden will lessen. Yesterday I tried applying for students loans through Wells Fargo's online site. I played with the parameters and these are my findings:

1. I cannot take out student loans because I am still under 18 years of age (17)
2. My father cannot take out the student loans for me because he and I both are living in Mexico rn.
3. The only eligible person in my family is my sister whom is graduating from a UC school this semester and will be moving on to Cornell grad studies in August. But I highly doubt she would help me because we've always had a toxic relationship.

So what do I do? Do I have any other options? I'm really dead set on studying at computer science at Penn state and I feel so lost and hopeless. Any advice helps, thank you!",1584670259.0

Current situation:

* $1200 payments will go to individuals 18 years or older who filed 2018 or 2019 tax returns and were not claimed as a dependent by anyone else.  Those individuals will also receive an extra $500 per dependent under the age of 18 claimed on their tax return.  These payments decrease for individuals making over $75,000 per year or couples making over $150,000, ultimately capping out at $100,000/$200,000.
* Individuals who are enrolled in college may be claimed as a dependent by their parents up to age 24.
* College students aged 18 to 24 who are claimed as a dependent by someone will NOT receive a stimulus payment, nor will their parents receive an extra dependent payment.

At least one US Representative has proposed an amendment that would make some sort of payment to college students claimed as dependents.

With respect to loans:

* Most federal student loans have been automatically put into forbearance for seven months.
* No interest is accruing on federal student loan balances during this period, and no payment is due during this period.
* Failure to make a payment during this period will have no impact on credit towards loan forgiveness programs, nor will it impact your personal credit.
* The federal government is not making your payments during this time, they are merely delaying the payments and extending the duration of your repayment plan accordingly.

The Education Department has posted a [list](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/allocationsforsection18004a1ofcaresact.pdf) of universities and colleges that will receive direct payments, along with what portion of that amount must be used for emergency financial aid grants to students (ht u/vicemagnet).

I am 18, and a senior in HS.

I've submitted my FAFSA and was told that I am not eligible for a Pell grant or any federal financial aid, assumingly since my parents income is too high.

My parents are unwilling to assist me financially through college since they believe I should just get a job straight away. They have excellent credit as well, but refuse to cosign on student loans for me.

I want to get a teaching degree to become a high school robotics/STEM teacher.

There is a very nice community college near my town which I plan to attend for 2 years and then transfer to a university to finish my BA.

I should be allowed to still live with my parents for my first 2 years at the community college, although I have no guarantee of that, and I would have to move for the last 2 years because I do not live close enough to the uni.

So essentially I am looking at:

- $6,000/yr ($4k tuition, $2k other stuff) for 2yrs COA @ community college = $12,000
- $20,000/yr ($8k tuition, $10k housing, $2k other stuff) for 2yrs COA @ university = $40,000

That's roughly $52,000 needed to get my BA for teaching.

How do I even go about getting a loan like this? And how much am I going to be paying back? From my research it seems Sallie Mae is likely the best place for private student loans, but I don't know.

I just recently turned 18 so I got a small $500 credit card so I can start building credit, but how good of credit will I need to get a loan like this? Is college even possible for me next fall?

Thanks for any input you can provide. I'm so stressed out from trying to figure out how I can go to college.",1576432904.0

I'm currently pursuing an undergrad degree at a CC and hope to transfer to a 4-year by Fall 2021, however my field of study (in the Sciences) is fairly competitive and requires more than just good grades to get into a good 4-year, i.e.: Major-Related Volunteer work, internships, etc. Plus I'll also be needing to pursue 2-4 years of grad school after finishing my undergrad.

Given that I'm attending a CC, I have virtually no tuition costs right now, just my living costs + transportation/books, misc expenses, etc. My initial plan was to just go to evening classes at my CC and work at a job during the day to pay for my basic costs (I'm paying for uni entirely myself), but I'm now realizing that that would leave me very little time for volunteering or strengthening my ability to get into a good school etc, so I've been wondering whether I should prioritize school fully (aka no job) and take out loans to cover my personal expenses in order to have more time for my academic career. To specify, given that I'm also eligible for non-repayable Financial Aid such as Pell Grants and whatnot, my loan amount would be around 7,000-10,000/yr. (so max. 30,000 for my entire Bachelors Degree).

I realize that taking out loans is a big decision and I plan on seriously thinking through this decision more before making a final call, but I'd really just like some insight on whether taking out loans seems like a good idea in this case or if it's better to take the safer option of working at a job while doing school, even if it might possibly make my ability to prioritize my academic career more difficult. Genuinely looking for honest answers here. Thank you!

This is not COVID related but back in January, my job (retail) cut hours drastically after the holiday season. To the point where I was only receiving 5 hours/wk (compared to 17-20 hours previously) Because of this, my paychecks were pretty much pennies and I was unable to put money towards my college savings. This lasted for about 8 weeks resulting in almost $800 of lost savings. For reasons, I quit that job a little while ago and currently I have another job and am back on track in terms of savings. But I still need to somehow make up the $800 before July when the Fall semester tuition is due.

1) I don't receive financial aid (i mean ZERO) because I do not qualify and 2) my parents do not and will not pay for my college. For the record, this is the reason why I made the decision to attend community college in the first place. Because I honestly did not want any financial worries. 

Anyhow, literally every need based assistance requires you to be a recipient of financial aid. I submitted an application to my school's emergency fund last week and spoke about my situation but honestly I doubt they'll come through bc it's probably based on financial aid. Even the minority based grants (I'm latino and black) require you to have some sort of ""demonstration of financial need"" (basically if you're receiving financial aid) The ""accelerated program"" I'm a member of doesn't help with tuition either because you need to be receiving some of fin aid.

I'm not trying complain or anything bc I do realize I'm in a better position than a lot of people but I'm just looking for a little assistance at this time and I just can't seem to find help anywhere.

1. Much cheaper than a regular university. You‚Äôll be saving lots of money in comparison to your friend who took out 20k in loans for a year.

2. Usually easier workload/ easier courses. 

3. Opportunity to have some great professors. 

4. Great place to start education for people who want to go back to school.

5. Lots of resources you‚Äôd get at any university.

Cons:
1. Hardly any opportunity for a social life. Unless you already have friends going to the school, you‚Äôre probably not gonna make new friends unless you join every club possible. There tend to be a lot of older students with kids/jobs so it‚Äôs difficult to relate. I didn‚Äôt make any friends (partially my fault, however I was a commuter so it was hard to stay around). 

2. Cont. of 1, Not many clubs/extracurriculars. Most people go home when class is over.

3. Poor academic advisement/counselors. I had several issues with counselors marking me as an out of state student, not submitting my tax forms, and overall not having an idea of what classes I needed in order to transfer. You get what you paid for, I guess.

4. Commuting and no on campus housing. I lived 45 minutes away from my college and had to drive all the way there and back. My classes were also all right next to each other because I didn‚Äôt have a lot of availability for the week because of my distance so it was exhausting.

5. Living at home with your parents. Not everyone still lives at home but a lot do in order to save money. I feel like I‚Äôm not independent and am still living like I‚Äôm 16 years old.",1588051302.0

I‚Äôve never accepted loans before, but I went into the system and accepted $1000 in subsidized loans. I thought I was accepting 1000 for the fall, but I guess it‚Äôs splitting 500 into each semester.

my top option? the new school in nyc 24k/yr with loans. my second option? vcu 7k/yr. im torn between the two because tns actually has what i want in terms of schooling, opportunity, major, etc. i could probably graduate early from there, got into their ba/ma program. honestly just wanna leave school as fast as possible to save money and time. if anyone has any insight with that, id appreciate it. i have until june to decide. my intended major/majors are english/creative writing and anthropology. 

thankfully, at either school i can live off campus and fin aid helps me with that. but i really wanna experience dorm life at least once ): i feel like ill be missing out. the problem with vcu is that theres only one dorm i really wanna stay at bc they have single rooms and i can stay over breaks in those dorms. but i still havent decided my college so i havent submitted a deposit, therefore, the likelihood of me getting that dorm feels very slim and im super sad about it. at tns, all dorms are open over break but theyre very expensive and there are few singles. 

i feel really anxious about it bc idk what to do. im worried that with the virus, school wont be on campus in fall so i wont be able to move in anyway. im concerned about being kicked out so it feels like off campus is the safest option. i can still move out if i need to.

this is a very stressful situation and if anyone has ever been in a similar boat and can help me decide, please do. ive felt very alone this entire college process like not to do a whole sob story but no congrats, wasnt allowed to tour schools, no support for my major, constantly getting yelled at for the schools i applied to and what i wanted to do. and so much more. i really feel like i dont have any fair options, i wish there was an in between school for me but there isnt. pls help lol",1588291629.0

It's to the point where I would gladly unenroll in all fall semester courses and just do something else.

The run-down is that I have two schools to choose from. School #1 is a really fancy ass private university with an amazing program, a gorgeous campus, etc. etc. The downside is that it costs more. (Actually not TOO much, though. Only about $15,000 a year.) (The college is Lafayette in Easton, PA, in case anyone is wondering.)

School #2 is SUNY Geneseo. Pretty decent program, campus is still pretty, but definitely not as good as Lafayette. Costs about $9,500 per year.

I could get away with no loans at Lafayette, because I plan to work two jobs every summer and I have some savings from working in the past, but I would have a lot less left over for my masters degree. What do y‚Äôall think? Is it worth it?

Is this fair?",4,da4fsw,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/da4fsw/gfs_college_closed_and_the_adopted_school_wont/,9,"Ok so my girlfriend was going to Argosy University (MN) which actually closed down earlier this year. Her program for Radiation Therapy was adopted by Amarillo College (TX).  Her program with Argosy hasn't really changed as far as curriculum, she just has to complete her clinicals which is 40 hours a week Monday through Friday and then 1 online class after which is for Amarillo's requirements.

Amarillo's Radiation Therapy program has a different curriculum. The students only do clinicals about 20 hours a week and have a couple extra classes they take. So my girlfriend is currently doing 40 hours of clinicalcs and not the extra classes. Now because Amarillo's curriculum includes clinicals *plus* classes, they are not giving her enough credits to be considered full-time status. How is this fair if she's putting in twice the amount of hours as Amarillos students? The loan company just needs her school to sign off on the form confirming she's full-time but Amarillo refuses to because she's not also taking classes regardless of the fact that she's doing 40 hours instead of only 20 hours as their curriculum requires.

This makes absolutely no sense to me. Why wouldn't they be willing to sign off as her being full time? The change in status is making her loan payments start immediately and we cannot at all afford them. I'm already supporting both us right now and she's already working 40+ hours for nothing doing clinicals and studying for board exams. Anyone have any input on whether we can do anything or are we completely at the mercy of the school with nothing to be done here?

Seriously thank you for any help or just even taking the time to read this. Appreciate it.

EDIT:  After getting more details from my girlfriend, I guess she's actually not trying to get ""full-time"" status but literally just ""half-time"" status. Her clinicals at Amarillo are now only considered a 5 credit course, and the school requires 6 credits to count as ""half-time"".  No matter what she tries to explain to the financial aid office about how their 5 credit Clinical course is only 20 hours a week while she's doing 40+ hours, they say they cannot do anything or sign off on her being ""half-time"".  So at this point we're trying to figure out how do we get her clinical credits counted to be more than the college's normal class which is 20 hours a week and gives 5 credits.",1569637592.0

**UNC-CH**

*pros*:

* nearby; easier to go home
* Planning on spending 4 years, but I‚Äôm coming in w a lot of college creds so I have legroom to double major
* prestigious institutional scholarship for URMs in STEM; provides mentoring, free tutoring, connections in STEM depts, tight-knit community, GRE prep, and guidance with grad school apps.
* Familiarity with campus and a lot of the student body! this would make for an easier adjustment and possibly better student experience
* school pride! People go hard for their school lol
* ‚ÄúBig fish‚Äù (not so little pond though lol). But I could be one of the higher-performing students - possibly stand out to employers/grad schools

*cons*:

* full ride first two years (no work study or anything), but may have to pay $9k for second two years (also possible to have most of the second two years covered). my point is: uncertainty ab $$ for jr and sr yrs.
* I‚Äôm not sure what my major is yet, but in case I wanted to do engineering, the only kind they have is BME
* i‚Äôm not crazy about UNC (even though it‚Äôs an awesome uni), so going there feels like the ‚Äúsafer‚Äù option
* Cornell is big, but UNC is bigger (around 20k ug enrollment). Idk if I want big
* More common to have big lecture halls (which I really don‚Äôt like)
* Would be staying nearby; I‚Äôve always wanted to go OOS for college, and idk if wanna stay in NC for the rest of my life lol

**Cornell**

*pros*:

* Far away; can go out of comfort zone
* Beautiful campus!!
* Nature nearby; botanical gardens, hiking, and gorges
* A lot more singles in ug housing, would be easier to get one if I wanted
* I got into this program in the CAS (Milstein Program for Technology and Humanity). Offers small seminars, exclusive speakers, and students spend two summers in NYC on the Cornell Tech campus
* Possible ivy connections? Idk if I should weigh this too much, but like the name may help w getting employment
* Though they don‚Äôt select students until after the May 1st deadline, there‚Äôs a scholarship (Kessler Presidential) that eliminates student summer contribution for FGLI students, provides community in the program, and helps students w networking and professional development
* diversity: there are big muslim and black communities there (whom I identify with).
* Great fin aid package! I‚Äôd be paying $5k/yr - possibly less if I get that earlier scholarship (which I *think* I‚Äôm a strong candidate for?)
* Dining halls have RLLY good food!! 
* very Interesting, unique, and niche-specific classes, which I‚Äôm excited about

*cons*:

* Out-of-pocket costs: $100 bus passes/yr after freshman year, $100/yr for gym and another $100 for fitness classes. Also cost of moving in and plane tix may be about $300 round trip
* I hear Ubers are expensive there
* ithaca is pretty rural; nearest big city is Syracuse, which is still about an hour away :/
* Housing isn‚Äôt guaranteed all four years, however fin aid can compensate for off-campus housing
* Housing is pretty random. You can pick a roommate but dorm ranking isn‚Äôt always followed. This may be an issue because older dorms are a little more run-down w no A/C and some are a lot newer and nicer
* Students may be stressed :( uncertainty about student culture/‚Äúvibe‚Äù bc I haven‚Äôt visited campus. I‚Äôve heard mixed things about friendly students and lonely students
* If I stay in that program in CAS, I couldn‚Äôt major in any engineering, but only minor in it
* I may be pretty average and not one of the relatively ‚Äúhigher-performing‚Äù students there",1587908013.0

Per the West Virginia Q&A on the r/WVU subreddit, WVU will not be offering any tuition refunds to students: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/fkyf08/qa\_thread\_318\_wvu\_moves\_all\_classes\_online/fkxy42a?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/WVU/comments/fkyf08/qa_thread_318_wvu_moves_all_classes_online/fkxy42a?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

I find this ridiculous. On average, WVU students pay \~$,2600 in fees per year for things such as free access to sporting events, the recreation center, the Library, etc. (Source:  [https://www.collegesimply.com/colleges/west-virginia/west-virginia-university/price/](https://www.collegesimply.com/colleges/west-virginia/west-virginia-university/price/) ) and it's likely more for larger and more expensive schools.

Obviously, because campus is closing, these resources are no longer available, meaning we are paying for things that we are not getting.

Even if we do a breakdown of the price to \~$1,300 a semester, and another half because we are only losing access for the second half of the semester, this is $650 that is simply unaccounted for. 

I know a lot of people will say ""Why do you want $650 back so much? It's not that much money.""

There are several of us who had to take out loans to cover these fees, including myself, which means we will in the long run end up paying more than the $650 price tag after interest.

Not to mention the bigger issue is that there are several families who are without jobs now and have no income or ways to pay for things such as rent and bills. $650 could be make or break money for a lot of families that again, is simply unaccounted for.

Is there anyone else out there very disturbed by this? That schools can just take money from us and we aren't getting the resources that we paid the money for? 

When people say Universities are run like businesses and don't care so much about education, I never felt I understood that more than I do right now.

What I'm talking about is he love attacking the idea of taking out student loans to pay for college. 

One, many people do not have families who save up money for them for college. So yeah student loans is a must at that point. Two, he shits on the students going to ridiculous expensive schools now I agree with him that's a stupid idea. But how is it student loans fault for that? shouldn't US schools and other schools in the world educate students to shop around for tuition prices? how is the US government or any other government fault for supporting students by funding them completely? let's all agree if you sign loans up for a school charging you $50,000 per tuition while the career you want is around $30k- 60k you are an idiot. No government financial aid is the reason why you got yourself into that debt and can't get out. You could have walk away for an affordable school. 

Second, Dave thinks parents should save I do agree to an extent you should if you WANT too. However, no one should be forced to support someone who chooses to do something expensive whether it's a degree, a house etc. The most important thing to save is for retirement not for your children's education. I'm sorry to say it it's true you need to secure your future when you retire first. If you can afford both then go ahead and do it but many studies have shown many people in many countries can't save for retirement or only save a few thousand of dollars. I'm surprised so many people are not bringing up how horrible that is! we are going to have a ton of people either relying on the goverment or on their families in the future. Save for retirement! if you don't want to save for your kids that should be okay too. 

People love taking advantage of their college fund by their parents. I heard so many stories of students blowing it on dumb shit other than college. If some middle-class parents decide they don't want to fund their kids that should be fine. But I also don't agree with denying middle-class students financial aid just because their parents should have saved. 

BTW, I don't hate Dave but for a while now what he been saying about student loan crisis, students in general been bothering me for a long time. If you really listen to it, what he saying sounds like it can only be applied to people who are well off. Someone who poor shouldn't really listen to everything that he saying. Yes don't go to a ridiculous expensive school but if you want a degree don't be afraid to take out loans if thats your only choice. 

I kinda want this to be a discussion about why some people think the loans for students are the evil? I think that's extreme to blame financial aid for the issue at hand all over the world (student debt). If anything it's the government fault for allowing tuition to get expensive not the loans.

Literally all of my financial aid goes to my housing, to the point where I don't have any left. I can't even use it for textbooks because it all goes to housing.

So I really want to go to college. I had two older sibling who went and they both love it. Not only that but I really want to grow in college from what I am now, as well as get an overall good education. My grades are actually pretty good right now and I already have a few schools in mind. The problem is I want to swim in college. I‚Äôm torn between the larger state schools, which have better swim teams (so I might not be able to swim) or smaller private schools, where I could definitely swim at. But, and this is a big but, my family isn‚Äôt that wealthy. They can afford to send me to college, with the help of my own work money, financial aid, and some loans, but they wouldn‚Äôt have a chance in hell to pay for a tuition of $45,000+ for a year, and I‚Äôd be even crazier to take out a college loan for that much. I also don‚Äôt want them to pay that much

The second problem I‚Äôm having is whether or not I want to go to a big school or a small school. Both have their upsides, both have their downsides. While smaller schools probably feel like more of a community, and it‚Äôs easier to learn in smaller classes, bigger schools have more choices of majors, different clubs I could join, and just an overall higher chance of maybe being able to find a good group of friends. 


The reason why this is a problem is because I‚Äôve gone to small schools, from elementary to high school, all my life, and being totally honest, I didn‚Äôt really like it. I would always get shut out of groups and everything, but that‚Äôs a topic for another time. I understand that even a small college would be MUCH larger than a high school, but I still feel like I want a larger college, I just don‚Äôt know why. Is it bad to think about college that way?

127,127,Considering joining the Air Force if classes go online in Fall 2020,0,gbnkaw,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/gbnkaw/considering_joining_the_air_force_if_classes_go/,5,"I have thought long and hard about it and believe it will be the best option for my future and I can always continue my education for no cost after 4 years active duty. The Air Force has a minimum requirement contract of 4 years Active Duty. I will be a senior in college this fall and I do not want to keep going in debt, currently around $40,000 in debt and it will be around 50-60k this year if I sign another loan. I have weighed the pros and cons, and it will allow me to start a fresh chapter in my life. Being at home sucks and I do not like living with my parents. The job market is getting worse, and rather than working in a crappy job while living at home (probably retail, factory work, or fast food), I will be working in the Air Force while they pay for my housing, food, and other expenses. The US Military budget is BIG, and I can see why it is huge because all of these things are paid for by the government. Also my interest rate will lower from 9% to 6% which will lower my expected monthly payments. Above all, if anything doesn't go to plan, my dad makes 90K a year so we aren't a poor family. And my grandpa is currently 88 years old and he has $2million in retirement so if he passes away (i do not intend to wish death upon anyone) then that is a life-changer financially for me and my family with debt.

My proposed life-plan is to enlist in the Air Force as potentially an E3 or E4 in Fall 2020 (or Spring 2020 if classes do not go online for my school), do basic military training which lasts 8.5 weeks. Then after BMT, all Airmen go to Air Force Tech School to learn their job function and attend classes (will take a couple-few months), all while in the process I get paid 30K a year so I can pay off my loans in 2-3 years before I step down from the Air Force. Then after the Air Force I plan ,on first finishing my bachelor's in Finance if its not already done, then get an MBA in 2 years while working at a job related in my field or whatever I can get at the time, then after that only time can tell what happens. I wouldn't mind If i get deployed, most Air Force airmen do not see combat and there is no Infantry for the Air Force, and you get to travel.  There are people that say the biggest downfalls of the military is not seeing your loved ones. But I am currently single, have no kids, and I kinda have a bad/distant relationship with my family (its complicated) so that will work in my favor. 4 years is not a long time in the grand scheme of things, and I plan on living to be 80-100 years old. When I realize this, I always think about how my current crappy circumstances in life are only temporary, and there are wide long roads ahead of me in the next 10, 15+ years.

&#x200B;

I will encourage more people to join the Military if you are partly fit and strong. I am almost 21 years old and run mostly everyday and on my college's cross country and track team, so the PT part of BMT will be easy. Air Force is considered to have the more easier basic military training than other branches, but you still have to be prepared for it and it totally depends on your squadron sometimes and they do yell in your face.

&#x200B;

Edit: I did the calculations, and with my current debt of around $42,000, my monthly payments to get debt free by the time I graduate the air force is $986 a month. The highest you can enlist as an Airmen is E3 (Airman First Class) and they get paid 2,042 per month, which is 24,504. But after taxes that is around 18,378 (taxes is around 25% of your income usually). i take that number divided by 12 and that is by monthly income, 1531 dollars. Paying $1000 per month is very doable and I will be able to save 500 dollars or pay for misc. stuff or extra food if need-be while at the Air Force Base. If I will wait to join the Air Force after graduating College (I do not currently plan to go in as an Officer), then my $65,000 in debt at %6 interest rate will be a monthly pay of $1,526 per month to pay it off in 4 years. Which is a lot more, and at that rate I will continue to pay on it for another year after the Air Force while I have a normal Civilian Job. I can always stay in the Air Force though if I believe it is a right fit for me. And I can talk to my parents or Grandpa to see if they can help too but I can't bet on that. Also going to copy this in the Air Force subreddit as well.

A bit of background on me: My parents are both immigrants, though my dad did go to college in the U.S. However, both of my parents are pretty old compared to most parents of kids my age, so I imagine the college situation has changed a bit since their time. In short, I'm pretty lost when it comes to this whole college ordeal, and I don't know anyone who can help guide me.
I've heard horror stories of people drowning in student loan debt and being unable to pay it back. Naturally, I want to avoid such a situation, but I don't know where to start. I've scoured around the internet looking for an explanation of what student loans are, but most places were discussing the problem with them rather than outright defining them. Here are my questions:

What are student loans?
How do you acquire them?
How do you avoid needing them in the first place?
If unavoidable, how do you make sure you can pay them off?

While searching reddit I read a comment stating that getting into student loan debt as an undergraduate is really unnecessary and worthless. I also read that one method is to go to community college for the first two years and then head off to a university of your choice for the junior and senior years. Is this viable? What do you guys think of these sentiments?

My school costs $27k a year including room and board. My program (aviation, high demand right now), costs an additional $70k for flight instruction and aircraft rental. This is a career I have been passionate about since I was five years old. The demand is there. But beginning pilots earn less than $50k a year. When you get seniority, you can see incomes upwards of $130k. But I'm  worried about the low income + HIGH student debt amounts.

With my Fall Semester bill due on the 23rd, I was looking into student loans (probably too late to just now be doing it, but whatever). Turns out my parents credit is absolute garbage because we somewhat recently became pretty dang poor (too recent for it to have had an effect on my financial aid that would have made college affordable).

Using Credible to look at prequalified rates for both only myself and with my mom as a co-sign returned absolutely nothing. I, obviously, have no credit built for me on my own. My dad would certainly be even worse, given he has a worse history than my mom over the years, and has probably had his credit score impacted more than my mom's. I asked an aunt today, but who knows if she'd be willing to co-sign for $15K for just one semester, or if it would even make that much of a difference? I know it's asking quite a lot.

There's also the fact I might not need $15K. That's what my bill shows me needing right now, but I should get at least $4K of it through federal loans 10 days before classes start. But I figure the difference between $11K and $15K isn't ridiculous, plus having the extra money might be helpful for expenses not on my school bill (idek if that's how student loans work tbh). Would asking for $4K affect my eligibility by a ton? Should I just ask for the bare minimum?

To put it bluntly, I don't know what to do. Next year should be easier; the updated tax returns will show our financial struggle and hopefully I can get more financial aid. But that doesn't help me now. I really don't know what to do, and if my aunt won't co-sign, I don't really have anyone else to ask. And even if she does, what if I still don't qualify for any loans? It also doesn't help that the bank I use doesn't offer student loans at all.

Basically, I'm lost. I don't know what to do, and don't even know where to begin to look for answers. I'm this  close to moving on to the next chapter of life and it seems like it's suddenly slipping away after I had already had everything planned.

My first instinct was to get a student loan, but since they look at the income of your parents to judge the amount of money you receive, Student Aid BC wouldn't be willing to give me nearly as enough money for my tuition. 

  
My parents together make a bit over the average middle-class income, but we are most definitely not rolling in cash. My mom works as a nurse and her income is enough to pay the mortgage and bills of the house on her own. My dad is retired, but he told me that he is willing to do contract work 8 hours away from home, for 2 weeks, 2 weeks at a time (2 weeks out, 2 weeks home) to give me enough money per month to pay for my tuition. My dad has done these contracts before, so I know how it impacts my mom being alone at the house. 

  
I just feel very guilty. Having to go do contract work for a total of 9+ months away from home just for me to pay my tuition. So I really want to make it up to my parents once I graduate and get a job with my schooling. I'm thinking I'll most definitely pay him the money back that they lent me, but I also feel like I should do something more, like throughout my schooling.

  
What's the best way to make it up to my parents for helping me so much?

  
**TL;DR:** My dad is doing contract work for 9+ months to pay for all my tuition. I'm extremely thankful but I also feel guilty and want to plan a way I can make it up to my parents both now and in the future once I graduate and get a job.",1582650311.0

Hope everyone is doing well. I am planning on doing Masters degree next year (currently an undergrad) and i did some research on the masters degree tuition fees and it shocked me. 

For undergradute degree it costs ¬£9,250.00 and its fully supported by the government, meaning you can take out a loan and pay back after you graduate and get a job (god bless this system lol).

Now with postgraduate degree like Masters you only get approximately ¬£10,000.00 for it in total. Place like UCL wants ¬£20,000.00 for one of their degrees.

Now my question is, where do I get the other ¬£10,000.00 ? Of course I can get a job but I was wondering if there are any other way to get extra funding, considering I would live alone, so rent, food, entertainment (if there would be any money left lol) will empty my pockets too?

‚Ä¢ live close to family incase of emergency

&#x200B;

I'm currently (at least in terms of timeline) a senior in college working on an Aerospace Engineering degree.  Let me provide some context for this post:

&#x200B;

I wanted to pursue a career in design and engineering, and since I loved aviation with a passion, I basically went straight to a university (the only one that accepted me) after high school, and pursued Aero Engineering.

&#x200B;

First year, wasn't the brightest. I went from going on academic warning to probation from first semester going onto second. I knew I screwed up, and I wasn't taking stuff seriously. This was an expensive school, and I had to use private loans to play a little less than 3/4 tuition since my grants and aid only covered 1/4. After the first year, I decided to step things up, and after passing two summer courses I transferred over from a local community college with straight As, I felt confident that I could recover.

&#x200B;

Second year, and I did just that. Both semesters, nearly all B's and A's. 3.0 term GPAs on each, and felt I was ready to be back on track. Again, took more summer courses to catch up, however only able to pass one class out of the two (I was taking Chem with Lab and Calc III, and I ended up passing Calc)

&#x200B;

Third year, it was okay in the first half. Took statics in the fall (technically was supposed to take that fall semester second year) and passed with a B, so I felt, again, confident going forward. Then, came a semester that the entire engineering college here knew as, ""The Gauntlet"". Basically, an entire semester filled with engineering science courses. I took 4, along with an aviation class for my technical elective. Failed 2 (Thermo and Solids), 2 were with D's (Fluid Mech and Dynamics), so I couldnt pass because of C or higher prereqs, and only passed my elective.

&#x200B;

Then, oh boy. Senior year. Retook about 3 of the previous classes, with an Electical Engineering class and lab. Passed that, but again, D's on the rest.. Now second semester comes, and i'm just here like, ugh, what is going on. Now, this semester, at least for the first half, I was under a lot of stress because I had a health scare and couldn't focus for the life of me. Now that everything migrated online after spring break, I had a chance to just fix what I could and focus harder, and now I can say that I'm doing better in those courses, though we'll have to see after finals.

&#x200B;

Point is, I just dont know how to feel it all anymore. Honestly, looking back, I feel that taking all those ES courses was a way of ""weeding"" me out of the rest. I feel like I should've just given up and did something else for a major for my own sake. But to me, I didnt want that. I came here for engineering, and I wasn't going to stop. A lot of acquaintances of mine say I was stubborn not to quit, but admitted that they admired me for that, though I can't say that really does me much. With all this debt I have already (Oh, dont worry, it's in the 6 figures already), and the fact I need another 2 years at least to finish, assuming I do, it just seems not practical to me in a sense. For those wondering, yes I did work part time for two years on campus. (I had to work more this year( about 30 hours a week) since I went off campus and was renting a room in a neighboring town.)  So I guess, from your guy's perspectives and, or experiences, what sort of words/advice can you give me?",1588043275.0

TL;DR: My parents have cut me off financially for reasons surrounding my mental health and I have no fucking clue where to start in terms of funding myself.

I'm hoping that maybe my mom is just really fucking uppity due to the current quarantine situation, but recently, my family was supposed to take a trip to the beach (bad idea), but I slept through my alarm and woke up at 1:30 PM (oops). They didn't try to wake me up earlier, which was odd, and on top of that decided to cancel all plans for the day instead of just going out themselves as if I'm an infant child who'll die if left alone for five seconds.

Rather than lecturing me about how this was a family thing and I shouldn't be waking up like this and asking if anything was wrong, my dad proceeded to tell me that he works his ass off and it's depressing to see me waking up so goddamn late all the time, and my mother came into my room while I was writing an essay and screamed at me for about an hour.

Pepper in some vague threats about killing herself because I don't listen to her and me having to convince her not to kick me out of the house right at this moment.

Honestly, I've been looking for a reason to get away from this house, so this might be an opportunity, but I can't say that I'm thrilled about how sudden it was or how shitty it made me feel. My biggest problem is that they spent my entire life trying to shelter me (wouldn't let me learn how to drive, didn't let me hang out with friends past 11 PM, told me not to take out loans or worry about finances) so I have no idea where the fuck to begin in terms of being able to support myself.

I dropped out during my second semester of my freshman year when I was 19. it was not a great choice and I still regret it. However, due to my lack of preparedness and not knowing what I wanted to study, I was overwhelmed by my studies and lacked motivation and concentration. Pre-Nursing was my main concentration during my freshman year at a four year university. I was not ready for the intensity and accelerating pace I had to go through with my prerequisites. I feel like a failure for not even completing my first year. During the times I was not in school, after dropping out, I worked at jobs with lots of hours along with its mediocre to terrible pay. I am thinking about enrolling back into college this fall, but I am still not sure what I want to focus on. One thing for sure is that getting a higher education is on my mind, despite the costly tuition. I am already deep in five grand of student debt from the first year at university. Furthermore I am also risking in changing my major from Pre-Nursing to Computer Science. I already know that working in the healthcare may not be for me even though I feel like it's more rewarding. After lots of research into software engineering, I have decided that it's the field I would most likely see myself doing longterm. I am highly interested in building my skills and knowledge in technology. It's a commitment to stick with this area of study and despite my anticipation in succeeding, is it worth going back to school? I don't know if I want to start again at a university or a community college. I am already trying to pay off my loans and it's difficult with the job I have-waitressing.

I went to my student login (University of Rhode Island, in-case it's important), went to my financial aid tab, and saw ""Apply for Loans"" and applied. Today 2 weeks or so before school starts I'm going through my student page to view all my information on what to do to prepare for school starting up. Out of curiosity I check my financial aid tab again to see how much I have owed this year.  About $2,000 or so after grants, aid, and loans. But then I realized that even though I have money to pay off my loans, I don't know **how** to do it.

So I went to the [Student Loans](https://studentloans.gov/) government website and clicked on the **How to Repay Your Loans** page, then to the **Learn How To Make A Payment** button. Which then lead me to the **Not sure who your loan servicer is?** header to which I then clicked the login button, which then brought me to my Student Aid account. Where I don't have any loans on my account to even check on. Then when I check my home page on the Federal Student Aid website there isn't a ""Pay Loan"" button anywhere. There are **View My Documents** which just shows me the MPN and Loan Counseling I already did, ""Complete Load Counseling"" which I did, and etc; nothing about just directly paying an amount towards the loan which somehow exists but doesn't.

Even though on my school's website it says my loans have been approved and printouts from the Federal Student Aid website that are disclosure statements showing the amount granted, I don't know where and how to pay the loan off when I need to. On the my student page from the school it says the loans are:  **Federal Subsidized Loan 810** & **Federal Unsubsidized Loan 820**, but when I click on them it just shows me how much was granted per semester. There also seems to be no way to pay loans from the URI website or student page and I'm left confused.

TL;DR Got granted a student loan from **Direct Loans** don't know how to pay it off.

Side Note: I looked up **Direct Loans** on google and got a page on the Federal Student Aid website saying ""As of March 15, 2016, Federal Student Aid has retired the Direct Loans Website"" and this [link](https://ifap.ed.gov/ifap/processing/directLoans.jsp). Which brought me nowhere.",1566434005.0

(stupid, I know) I was awarded enough money to cover my cost of attendance, which was about $43,000. However, a huge chunk of it was the Direct ParentPLUS loan. Again, I was 18 and very naive at the time at that bc my school had awarded me enough aid, that I was good. I didn‚Äôt know that my parents had to apply and be approved. They weren‚Äôt in the position to co-sign on loans for me at the time because I have a twin sister and older brother who are all in college as well. 

Long story short, I left that school after my first semester, and now have an outstanding balance of $18,000. I‚Äôve been taking classes at my local community college while I figure my situation out. Back in August, my former advisor from the university contacted me and asked if I was interested in coming back to the school. She said that they would offer me a retention scholarship of $10,000. On top of that, they would cover an additional $1,000 of my outstanding balance, and I would just have to come up with the $7,000 difference. Should I accept, I would have to return to the school for at least a full year. I would love to go back more than anything, but I don‚Äôt wanna be in the same boat as I was the first go around, with no being able to afford it.

All standalone posts on these topics will be removed.**

If you want money for college, you should submit a [FAFSA](http://www.fafsa.gov) if you are [eligible to do so](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/eligibility).

2019-2020 school year: Use the 2019-2020 FAFSA, which opened October 1, 2018. This one requires 2017 tax information.

2020-2021 school year: Use the 2020-2021 FAFSA, which opens October 1, 2019. This one requires 2018 tax information.

**First time? Here's a step-by-step guide to the financial aid process.**

1. Create an [FSA ID](http://www.fsaid.ed.gov). This is your legal electronic signature to sign your FAFSA. It's linked to your Social Security number. If you are a dependent student, one of your parents will need to make one as well. If your parent already has an FSA ID (for themselves or for other children), they must use their existing FSA ID.

2. Gather all necessary documents, including bank statements, tax information (W-2s, tax returns), any records of untaxed income, etc.

3. Start the FAFSA! If you or your parent are given the option to use the [IRS Data Retrieval Tool](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/resources/irs-drt-text), use it! It will drag tax information from the IRS straight to the FAFSA and save you a lot of time.

I go to a community college in NY. For the past year and a half I have been working on my degree (math/ science concentrated physical science.) Each semester I go in for advising to have someone help me sign up for classes so I do not mess anything and stay on track. This week I am doing my final semester advising and I was told that I will not be able to graduate on time. (Due to a series class requirement.) They said I should switch degrees to individual study's or another degree so I can graduate.

(you cant skip this) How is this fair? Ive been taking out thousands of dollars in loans and accepting certain scholarships in good faith that every-time i went in and told them specifically ""Im here to sign up for classes, what do I need to sign up for to graduate and stay on track. (Not only once, but four times.) I would be less mad but they literately assured me each time after me getting clarification multiple times that I will graduate on time with these classes I signed up for. Its their job! Why didn't they catch this at any of the other three appointments? It seems like utter incompetence on their part. And now they want me to switch the degree as a solution? At 17 I had to take out my first loan which now adds to 10k for the degree I chose.

This probably means they will take my Excelsior away for the year I got it, unless I go to the easy degree. If I get that degree then the colleges I wanted won't even look at me.

It‚Äôs an entirely different issue altogether when you don‚Äôt even have a college around you.

A¬†recent report¬†from Jain Family Institute (JFI) reveals that access to college isn‚Äôt¬†just about the cost of college. Physical access to public higher education institutions across America has also been highly unequal.¬†

Specifically, as detailed by¬†JFI‚Äôs interactive map, regions in America‚Äôs West have little-to-no access to an institution of higher education, compared to the East Coast.


‚ÄúOne of the major takeaways when you're looking at the map is the staggering amount of populated areas that are considered highly concentrated,‚Äù Laura Beamer, higher education finance project lead at JFI and one of the two authors of the study, told Yahoo Finance. ‚ÄúWe figured out that roughly 2.4 million prospective students have access to most one public option nearby ‚Ä¶ Though financial access is extremely important, geographic access is also a very important piece of this dialogue and should be talked about more.‚Äù


The Rocky Mountain region ‚Äúis the worst off,‚Äù the report added, ‚Äúfollowed closely by the Plains region.‚Äù¬†

The JFI report ‚Äî¬†which drew on various points of data from the 2016-17 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, enrollment data from 2017, the 2016 5-year population, and median income estimates from the American Community Survey, driving durations to higher ed institutions in the area, zip codes, and more ‚Äî created a ‚ÄúSchool Concentration Index‚Äù which measures the variation across the higher education market across different types of schools in the U.S. and U.S. territories.¬†

Four states ‚Äî Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming ‚Äî were found to have higher education institution monopolies or close to it, meaning that there is only one institution or very few schools to choose from.



‚ÄòPrime hunting ground for for-profit institutions‚Äô

The authors found that a highly concentrated zip code (in red) means that there are few ‚Äî or in some cases zero ‚Äî higher education institutions in the area. A low concentration implies that there are a wide variety of options available for prospective students.

In the U.S., 38% of the population lives in highly concentrated zip codes, where they have access to very few or no higher education institutions, according to Beamer and her co-author Marshall Steinbaum, who is also an assistant professor of economics at the University of Utah. If a student from these areas wanted to attend a college or university, their commute would be at least 45 minutes.

The unequal access has wide-ranging implications for prospective students, most of them negative.

Parts of the U.S. where there‚Äôs ‚Äúlittle to no access‚Äù to a higher ed institution ‚Äúare prime hunting ground for for-profit institutions, just as they are known to draw disproportionately from populations historically excluded from traditional higher ed on the basis of race and class,‚Äù the authors argued.

The for-profit higher education sector saw tremendous growth since the financial crisis. In 2016, the¬†New York Fed¬†noted that enrollment at these schools had ‚Äúskyrocketed‚Äù as the country emerged out of the Great Recession. For-profit colleges have also been known to saddle graduates with¬†high levels of student debt, and in some cases, provide low-quality education with¬†false promises of job placement.

The Obama administration‚Äôs crackdown on for-profit colleges led to several closures, and recent action by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)¬†pushed the University of Phoenix to put a stop¬†to deceptive advertising of lucrative job opportunities.

Despite government action, for-profits persist due to these gaps in availability.



‚ÄòA school could ... possibly practice price discrimination‚Äô

So why are schools so unequally distributed across the U.S. in the first place?¬†

‚ÄúIt comes down to the structure that that states have put in place and just haven't been able to update over the last few decades,‚Äù Beamer said. ‚ÄúThere is a rural versus urban dynamic as well ‚Ä¶ schools are going to open in places where there's a labor market and where there's a large population of students.‚Äù¬†

The biggest problem arising is a neglect of the West, the researchers argue, where ‚Äúa school could determine prices and access unilaterally and possibly practice price discrimination.‚Äù

More broadly, the issues raises a more philosophical question about what higher education represents.

‚ÄúWe have this idea that higher education as a societal institution is egalitarian ‚Ä¶ there's also a lot of reasons why it isn't,‚Äù said Steinbaum. ‚ÄúThis is one tiny piece of evidence among a broad painting of the fact that the higher education system is extremely stratified.‚Äù

‚ÄòThey're screwed on the front end‚Äô as well as ‚Äòthe other end‚Äô

Another problem of ‚Äúeducation deserts‚Äù trickles down below higher education.

‚ÄúFolks in these certain geographic areas which more often tend to be rural, have fewer options,‚Äù Ryan Wells, associate professor of higher education at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told Yahoo Finance.

Rural students not only had fewer options for college, he explained, but they also had fewer resources to prepare them for college in the first place when compared to their suburban or urban counterparts.

‚ÄúIt's kind of like ‚Äî¬† to put it crassly ‚Äî they're screwed on the front end with what they have with their preparation and their resources and things to be ready for college,‚Äù Wells said, ‚Äúand then fewer options on the other end as well.‚Äù


Responsible colleges offer a way out

Fortunately, there are some good actors that restore faith in the system.

The University of Wyoming ‚Äî¬†despite having ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù status ‚Äî takes its job to offer accessible higher education seriously.¬†

‚ÄúWe are quite a blue-collar state,‚Äù University of Wyoming spokesperson Chad Baldwin told Yahoo Finance. ‚ÄúOnly about 24% of our adults have a bachelor's degree or higher [so] one of our goals is to try to lift the educational attainment level.‚Äù

Baldwin noted that the university has a broad open admissions standard: ‚ÄúOur acceptance rate is something in the order of 97%.‚Äù Furthermore, according to Baldwin, more than half of the university‚Äôs graduates who started as first-time students didn‚Äôt graduate with any student loan debt, thanks to low tuition and fees, and a state scholarship program.

‚ÄúThe tuition for a Wyoming resident undergraduate for a year is about $6,300,‚Äù he added.

Factoring in living costs and so on, that comes up to about $13,000 per year, based on data from the¬†Department of Education‚Äôs College Scorecard

I recently graduated with a Bachelor in Sec Math Ed and I wasn't able to pass the EdTpa for my license (IL requires it) and I have been juggling my options recently. My thoughts are

1.) redo Edtpa. This would take a ton of work and $200-300. I am not sure if I would want to try it a second time but it has been on my mind. If i did, it would only be 1 more time I believe.

2.) apply to another state nearby that doesn't require the edtpa. Allows me to be a teacher without the pain of doing the edtpa again. Also depends on other state requirements(looking at Missouri) 

3.) be a para-professional. I already got my license for that and it also allows me to sub when I want.

4.) Further education to be a math professor. Id love this but i dont have a huge nest egg and am currently working on my previous loans atm. The only way I could be comfortable doing this is possibly getting a good scholarship or apprenticeship. I got above average grades throughout college (got cum laude), but it was very stressful having a scholarship be the only thing keeping me in school. 

5.) taking a break from education and getting a different job for a year or two. This would be to just give myself time and money to figure out what I want to do if I can't make it up relatively soon.

""CA Governor Gavin Newsom recently announced CA public schools will be closed indefinitely until the Summer amid the fear and concerns over COVID 19, however, I urge Gov. Newsom to cancel instruction for the spring 2020 semester at all public colleges, before millions of college students will be negatively affected.

Given that the recent panic and negative effects that COVID 19 has had on our daily lives, schools have done a tremendous job in accommodating students through online alternatives for in-person classes, despite many of the on-campus facilities closing and instructors rapidly adjusting schedules and lesson plans. While college institutions should be applauded for their tremendous efforts to do so, I argue that we need to essentially cancel instruction of the spring 2020 semester. 

Why? On-line instruction through zoom conferences or through skype are inadequate for many college students in providing an efficient learning environment.  College students are already facing issues like academic pressure, homelessness, and student loan debt. We can not expect college students to conduct research, do their assignments, or classwork without negative effects on their grades or academic record. Moreover, many students without computer access in their homes cannot possibly continue with their studies. I strongly urge CA Gov. Newsom, along with the cooperation of the University of California (UC), California State Universities (CSU), and California Community Colleges (CCC), to cancel instruction at public colleges for the spring 2020 semester""",1584787106.0

I wish they had classes on taxes, how to budget, taking out a loan, cooking, proper diets, and the importance of mental health. 

There are enough subjects that are taught in high school that we don't ever use. One would think that having a robust and effective/practical approach to educating kids so they are set up for success is obvious. But the states are not doing it.

I just want to hear as many perspectives and opinions on this topic. The questions:
1. Why haven't we revamped our education system giving  the information we have now to help decide what to do?
2. Why aren't teachers getting paid more?
3. Isn't educating the younger generation one of the best steps to take to better the future? Shouldn't it be a top priority?
4. Why is education not taken seriously in the US?

Before now, I had only enrolled in college (the one I am attending) one time which was in 2014 and I didn't realize when I dropped out that I withdraw incorrectly.

I found out at the beginning of this semester that I was in a warning semester (academic probation) because of the incorrect withdrawal. I was still able to receive aid and register for classes. I spoke with an advisor (who knew I was in a warning semester) and registered for classes accordingly with what she said I needed to do; repeat the classes I was supposed to take in 2014 for a total of 13 credit hours.

I find out today from the financial aid office - while checking on something in my student account - that it looks like I needed 16 hours, not 13 this semester, and that my account shows 26 attempted hours and 13 completed (the 13 I am registered for this semester). The woman I have been speaking with today said that if I don't have the required GPA (1.75) or completion rate (62%) at the end of the term, then my financial aid status could be changed and I would be deemed ineligible for aid for spring. In my student account, I have spring aid waiting for me. I don't have the money to pay for spring out of pocket.

I have been working hard all semester and will have A or B averages in all of my classes at the end of the term. Do I simply need to either have a 1.75 GPA or a 62% completion rate in order to bring my status out of a warning and into good standing or will it not matter with me being 3 credit hours short? Are credit hours the only way to meet the GPA or completion rate requirements?

90,90,Can Blockchain Save Us From The Student Loan Crisis?,0,8vw1gl,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/8vw1gl/can_blockchain_save_us_from_the_student_loan/,12,"In short answer: YES.

Here is how: 

Blockchain technology is poised to disrupt every industry.

Unfamiliar with Blockchain? You are not alone... 

When it comes to education, what you need to understand is that Blockchain allows for the elimination of middlemen in a huge scope of industries.

It does this through what's called ""Smart Contracts"".

Here's how this works: 

Let's say Pete wants to buy Tim's house. In the past, this would require a huge number of middlemen to get involved... It would be impossible for Tim and Pete to just exchange currency for the house.

With the help of the Ethereum blockchain, this is no longer the case.

Through the power of smart-contracts, Tim could send Pete the deed to his house over the blockchain once a certain amount of currency has been transacted.

Check out this post on the Ethereum subreddit that details out this process:

https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7p155y/i_just_warranty_deeded_my_house_into_an_ethereum/

So what does this mean for student loans?

It means that, more than ever, SCHOOLS ARE PREPARING STUDENTS FOR JOBS THAT WILL NO LONGER EXIST.

Quite soon, anyone paying attention will easily see the bafoonery being propagated by the mainstream education system.

Take a moment and consider what a young kid raised to be familiar with the ramifications of Blockchain will have to say about the mainstream college system...

That individual will likely be educated beyond where we are today.

Have you talked to smart 18-19 year olds lately?

They are technologically fluent beyond anything that even me (a 26 year old) is capable of understanding... Although maybe I'm just a bit slow ;) 

But here's my point:

If you think that student loans sound like a bad deal TODAY, give it another 5 years and the obviousness of the scam will be clear as a used car salesman in a parking lot.

Every industry is about to be disrupted.

Jobs will be radically changed.

The education system is drenched in red tape that will prevent them from adapting.

I believe the citizenry will demand a better way... One that they realize they can engineer themselves way easier than anything the government organizations can assemble.

The end of the education industry as we know it is at hand. ",1530682355.0

From memory, the course was free, which also makes sense, as it would likely be quite difficult for a 14 year old to take out a student loan, and based off of the footage on the news story it didn't look like his family had lots of money to spend on such a thing.

Does anybody happen to know what site/resource he used to get his degree from, or if there are others that match the criteria of free and online?

134,134,The Great Student Loan Issue,2,8gf3u3,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/8gf3u3/the_great_student_loan_issue/,3,"I'm here to address the corruption of the student loan industry and advocating for either a reinstatement of bankruptcy provisions for the honest but unfortunate debtor, or to encourage the 4\+ million individuals in default to flood the bankruptcy courts with petitions to discharge their student loans in a effort to force the governments hand.

The reality of the bankruptcy issue is this: in the late 1970's Ms. Brunner graduated with ""XYZ"" degree, then filed for [bankruptcy](https://www.bankruptcyinbrief.com/student_loan_brunner-htm/) a few months later \(before her post grad deferment ended\). Simultaneously, Congress was being lobbied to ""be afraid"" of the student loan bankruptcy scandals that were upon them, and thus without any [empirical data](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1894445) Congress redacted the right to bankruptcy for student loans, essentially making it the only consumer debt that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. Thus the development of the ""[Brunner Test](https://www.thebankruptcysite.org/resources/bankruptcy/debt-relief/student-loans-bankruptcy-the-brunner-test)"" was created.

There has been a variety of modifications to the bankruptcy code since the late 70's, but the notable thing to understand is that student loans are excepted from bankruptcy unless the debtor can show that repayment would constitute an undue hardship \(this is codified under [11 U.S. Code 523\(a\)\(8\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/523). The ""loop hole"".

The Brunner Test is the most widely implemented standard for determining undue hardship across the 11 Circuit Courts \(9 of 11\), while other tests also exists, the only other substantial test is the [Totality of Circumstances Test](https://www.abi.org/member-resources/blog/the-eighth-circuit%E2%80%99s-leniency-on-discharging-student-loan-debt).

The difficulty is that Congress has, presumptively, not ""defined"" undue hardship in the bankruptcy code \(with respect to 523\(a\)\(8\)\). Thus the entire judiciary throughout the 11 Circuits for years now has interpreted/applied the undue hardship evaluation\(s\) in both wide scoped and contradicting manners. This wide range are variable applications should be viewed as a violation of the United States Constitution \(Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4\) authorizes Congress to enact ""**uniform Laws**on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.""

We \[society\] find ourselves now in the mist of the onset of another ""recession"". Student Loans, as of 2014, have become the [second largest](http://dailybruin.com/2014/03/31/student-loans-is-second-largest-source-of-debt-in-us-households-says-recent-study/) household debt, second only to mortgage \(and some project are on track to [overtake mortgages](https://www.finder.com/student-loans-to-overtake-mortgages) in the coming years\), and are valued at over $1.5t rillion and growing by the second. Unlike the ""bubble"" of the recent *great recession*, the student loans ""crisis"" is like a boa constrictor that is suffocating the economy. What we are seeing is asset backed securities and other ""pre great recession behaviors"" with respect to student loans.

Reports have already been linked to [low reproduction](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2013/0130/Behind-the-falling-US-birthrate-too-much-student-debt-to-afford-kids), [home buying](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/where-we-live/wp/2017/10/19/report-student-loan-debt-delays-homeownership-by-seven-years/?utm_term=.d586d55d8fdb), auto sales, credit card acquisitions, and various other economic stimulations as a result of student loan debt.

For those facing dire straights they are bombarded with media that suggests that student loans in bankruptcy are nearly impossible. YES, it's a mountain not a mole hill to climb, but the empirical data already suggests that more than 50&#37; that petition to discharge their loans in bankruptcy obtain some relief. However, it is estimated that less than 1&#37; of individuals that file bankruptcy while holding student loans even attempt the process.

The ""process"" required that the individual file a separate lawsuit within the bankruptcy case against the student loan entities \(lenders, guarantors, and service providers\). The average bankruptcy attorney charges anywhere from $1,200 \- $2,000 just to file the bankruptcy petition, and the ""process"" \(known as an adversary proceeding\) is still guess work for the majority of law firms, and they typically set the fees from the $10k\-$20k\+ range.

So for an individual that is facing such hardship they go bankruptcy, the legal institutions are designed to then make it impossible to ""seek"" the fresh start. It's a classic catch\-22. If you're so bad\-off you need to file bankruptcy, then how the hell can you afford a $20k debt for an attorney \(that cannot be bankrupt since it's ""post"" petition\).

I've had some very amazing engagement with folks on Reddit about the repayment plans, and their never\-ending grip on individuals. The basics: you enroll into a repayment plan that extends the life of the loan by 20 or more years, often times associated with a &#37; of the income, or various other calculations. For the build of individuals, they, if lucky, get ahead of the accruing interest. Sadly, the majority will watch the loans grow while in these extended repayment plans because they can't get ahead of the interest.

The so\-called silver lining is that after the extended repayment period is over \(20\+ years\) the ""left over"" loan is forgiven. Two issues here: 1, the government could ""amend"" these plans down the line and basically remove them \(we are seeing similar behaviors with the ""[borrower defense](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense#help)"" and ""[Public Service Loan Forgiveness](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service/questions)"" programs under the current administration; and 2, the ""forgiven"" amount, will be considered taxable income. Therefore, unless the individual is ""insolvent"" at the forgiven time period, they are on the hook for even more ""non dischargeable bankruptcy debt"" \(IRS taxes\). Sure, if the individual is insolvent at the time of the forgiveness they can declare bankruptcy, this leads to too perspective: 1, it encourages people to basically live in poverty for the next 20\+ years, or 2, we are truly expecting that our college educated folks will be so dire that they will again face financial hardship nearing the end of their lives that they can find comfort in bankruptcy in their 60's/70's? HOLLY SHIT!

I've been working closely with some folks to try and create an alternative service where we can provide individuals with all the tools needed to file bankruptcy, and initiate the adversary proceeding without an attorney \(a mock turn\-key approach\) to assist an increase in the volume of bankruptcy petitions to bottleneck the system and force the hand of the Government. Unfortunately, there are a lot of \(forgive the rudeness\) uneducated haters on Reddit that keep trying to bash this approach, because they themselves are shills for the Student Loan industry, or have no personal experience in the student loan bankruptcy arena \(or are lawyers that just want the $20\+k \(among a few potential rationals\).

So my questions for ya'll in this Lounge is this:

1. Whats your understanding of the student loan situation?
2. What are your thoughts on what needs to change/how?
3. \(Consider the turn key approach as valid\)... if a large volume of bankruptcy petitions hit the courts overnight, would this actually force the hand of the Government to finally do something about this current state we find ourselves in.",1525268674.0

Is it such a groundbreaking discovery to learn that middle class and less kids will never have the opportunity of upper class, no matter how educated they are. Is it such a shock to know that every single privileged kid who has mommy and daddy pay for everything will have more of an ""in"" than the kid who may have great grades, but who's parents are unstable to help them afford college. Is it so very disturbing to know high ranking educating officials are paid off, and finally is it honest so bewildering why kids now hate the rich more than ever, and are against unfair colleges only aiding the rich and privileged.
I have said for years that the foundation of the US system, including the very educational system, is to make the rich get richer, and the poor only well off enough to aid the rich. No matter how smart a kid is, he is only worth as much as he can take out in a loan to go to school, or how much money he can make the school. This scandal of school has been for coming a long time, and I'm glad I finally have been able to see it. Simply put, garbage In, garbage out. The only difference is that the rich make the garbage smell nice, but it's up to the middle class to clean up their mess.

223,223,Is going to college worth the debt burden to go?,41,bcdm9m,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/bcdm9m/is_going_to_college_worth_the_debt_burden_to_go/,31,"Back in the 1960s prospective college students could often go to college and pay for the cost of a state college with Pell grants and a part-time job.

But today colleges are so expensive that the typical student must take out commercial loans offered by for-profit banking institutions -- loans that cannot be discharged by the student, a life-long burden of [debt peonage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_bondage).

Noam Chomsky noted the new dynamic saying:

> Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt they can't afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and by the time students graduate, they are not only laded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinarian culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy.

[Statistics say](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112432364) that the debt and for-profit interest payments accumulated by college students will pay off long down the road by a higher income by the college student. This turns the goal of college from being one of seeking knowledge to a goal of ""job training"" and seeking a high income to pay off debts and thus escape [debt peonage](https://www.antislavery.org/).

What is worse is that [nearly half of millennials say college wasn't worth the student-loan debt](https://www.thisisinsider.com/millennials-college-not-worth-student-loan-debt-2019-4).

Read that again: *Nearly 1/2!*

At a time when it *is common* for other advanced countries in Europe to offer *free college* we in the US have created a for-profit system in which *nearly 1/2* of the participants going to college say it is not worth it -- statistics be damned.

Background: I have poor grades due to unhealthy childhood environment. As soon as I could, I ran away from home and lived mostly for survival. But I suddenly had my moment of clarity of what I finally wanted to do in life.

I'm nearing my 30s(f) but I feel like I'm out of time. I'm doing my master's now on top of a full-time job. My job however is not related to what I want to do but it keeps the bills, loans, and school tuition paid.

I was thinking to get another bachelor degree (related to what I now want) and to pull up my GPA, but I'm also doing volunteer work (related to what I now want). If I choose a second degree, I have to stop volunteering.

1. Could I apply for an international scholarship, say Chevening or Erasmus, with below average GPA, so-so work experience, and a non-related bachelor degree to what I want to apply for?

2. Or should I go get a second degree but I have to stop volunteering/gathering work exp, just so I could apply for a scholarship? Will that help me get an international scholarship?

3. What are other options out there to increase my credentials to an international standard or exposure? Aside from IELTS because I would take that too once I finish my master's. Just in case, I'm also learning 2 languages during my free time.

Back in January he took a lot of time off because he was in a really bad place mentally. He had had constant communication with his tutor about this however at this time he wasn't submitting any work. 

When he was ready to come back to the uni he got papers from the doctor to confirm his diagnosis and treatment (as the uni had asked him to do). He contacted his tutor again who told him everything would be fine he just needed to submit ONE ASSIGNMENT. He then contacted student finance as he had noticed that he hadn't received his loan when he was supposed to. THEY informed him that he was no longer enrolled on a course and he wont be receiving any more payments. The uni had removed him from the course and simply didnt tell him. He contacted his tutor and was told that  if he submitted certain pieces of work that he would be put back on the course and could start receiving finance again.

 To summarise, he was told he needed to submit 1 assignment and that he was still on his course and everything was fine, he was then informed by someone other than the uni that he was in fact removed from the course, his tutor then told him he has to submit 3 assignments to be put back on despite what he had previously said.  My boyfriend did the work he had to do and sent it off. His tutor vanished for 2 weeks and ignored all the emails. During this time my bf was receiving eviction letters as he had missed his rent payment. 

When the tutor finally responded he told my bf that he now has to do more work if he wants to receive his finance. My boyfriend is having to decide between having food or having electricity. I'm helping him out financially and putting myself into debt so he doesn't starve. His family receive very little from the work that do and his mum has 2 other kid to look after. They help when they can. He has been looking for work for the past month or so but he's had no replies. 

This has all caused him to relapse into another depressive episode. He understands that he needs to complete his work to get paid but he's really struggling to get anything done now due to constant hunger and depression. I dont feel like the uni have any right to hold him at ransom like this. He is starving himself and has received more eviction notices. His tutor lied to him about his situation and lied to him about being removed from the course. He also lied about the amount of work he needs to do to get put back on the course. Every time he submits something he has to submit something else to receive his money. He's now missed 2 student fiance payments.

I'm trying to get myself into UT austin I have the sufficient grades but the problem for me is the Fafsa loan.

Yes I can apply but my dad earns well over the limit of 50000$ to be eligible. Due to other loans he is still paying off he cant afford to pay for the expensive course at UT austin ( I'll be attempting to transfer after the 2nd year in my college which is when everyone will be doing it in my course ).

I want to go to UT because it has some boxing gyms right there where I can learn and develop my passion in boxing and I have an uncle in dallas. So kinda near by. No i dont have any professional experience in boxing. I do practice in a gym but the facilities in india are too less for me to take it seriously, thats why I want to transfer to UT.I will be trying to apply by october of this year during my 2nd academic year to transfer for the 3rd year at UT.

Any advice on a loan which you guys would recommend and what I should do would be nice.
I am thinking of applying for an academic loan but I still dont know my final first year GPA yet.

I know its complicated and seriously even I am confused about what to do. But any advice would be much appreciated and thank you for reading so far, honestly even I am getting a headache reading all of this XD

Edit: Okay so also I forgot to mention, my dad is super unsupportive of my boxing, so me going to US for a finance degree will help me get an excuse to go to US and train under the facilities and also allow me to have a back up plan for the future. You guys know how asian parents are right?",1555795157.0

We don‚Äôt have a full time job - fair enough but we get a loan which we can use. Plus we do have a stable income of the loan coming in every couple months. It is up to the person to make a payment just like in a full time job. Both parties are binded by a contract.

They trash the place - first of all you get references which can check what type of tenant you are for both students and normal people. Both parties can trash the place. 

I don‚Äôt get why we are expected to stay in halls or be in a house share. Like hello maybe I want to have a normal flat and normal life.

You‚Äôll be charged this when you first use the card, and annually on the same date every year thereafter.""

&nbsp;

Example: A student needs $10k for a semester (or coding bootcamp). They go to a financier and get $10k upfront structured as debt. If the student doesn't graduate they're required to pay back the principal plus interest as if it were a standard loan. If the student does graduate the principal plus interest converts into an income share agreement where the financier is entitled to X% of the former student's income over a specified period of time.

&nbsp;

It's better than a loan for students because there's no defined principal that they have to pay down if they graduate. It's better than an income share agreement for investors because if the student doesn't graduate the dispersed funds are still treated as a loan.

Matter at Hand: Teaching assistant, Laboratory assistant, PhD students, Instructor(newly graduate or yet to finish) are not happy about their wage.

Data before the strike: TAs earn guaranteed $4000+ per year Ôºàpaycheck mailed every month) for a total of 105 Hours. Whether there is tutorial or not, you get the check.
Lab & PhD & Instructor that I am not familiar, but according to their claim, PhD is earning $15000 per year well below Ontario Poverty line $19000.

My complaint: no one seems to give a s‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about students whose classes and tutorial are cancelled due to the strike. Keep in mind people, students are studying on loans they have to pay back later. Among them, international students are paying $3000 plus per course per semester (roughly $200 a single lecture). An average degree in UoT costs them $120,000. Now they are closing in on finals, who is gonna compensate for the knowledge that is part of their future credentials?

This world is simply getting more absurd every day. If you are not in the system, but an average employee, you are screwed both ways, for no one gives f‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• anymore.

Out of the six programs, I only got into one PhD at a great public university. However, while one of the Ivy League schools that I applied to did not admit me into the PhD program, they did admit me into one of their M.A. programs. It has always been a dream of mine to study at an Ivy League school, and this is finally my chance to do so. However, I already have two previous Master's degrees, and a ton of student loan debt. I already accepted the spot at the PhD program at the public university back in March; however, the admissions from the Ivy came earlier this week. This change in events has made me rethink my academic career path, and I wanted to reach out to this wonderful community for some advice. The way I see things, below are some pros and cons for both options:

1) PhD Program at Top-10 Public University

a) Pros: No tuition payment; great benefits and a reasonable stipend; get to embark on my PhD journey this year instead of waiting another two years; get to work on interesting and original research right away; school is close to home so I would be able to visit family frequently; cost of living is much lower than at the town where the Ivy is located.

b) Cons: Terminal degree (meaning that my dream of studying at an Ivy would not happen); focus of the program is more local than global in nature; faculty are young and not as established as the Ivy faculty at the program.

2) M.A. Program at Ivy League School

a) Pros: Get to fulfill dream of studying at an Ivy League school; faculty are well established in their respective fields; focus of the program is much more global in nature; cultural activities and centers available at the town where the school is located are innumerable; have some friends in the area (so I will not be completed alone in a new place); access to a strong and well-established alumni network; additional two years to prepare for a PhD program (greater maturity and a better idea of what kind of research to focus my future PhD program dissertation on); opportunity to work as a research assistant during my time at the school.

b) Cons: Extremely high cost of living; need tons of new student loans to afford program; sets me back two years to start my PhD program; would not be as close to family and would be not able to visit them as frequently; diminishing returns of obtaining a third Master's degree.

&#x200B;

Also, my goal is to complete a PhD program, whether it starts this year or two years after the Master's degree. Ultimately, my goal after completing my doctoral studies is to work at an international organization or think tank on climate, sustainability, and natural resource issues.

I welcome your thoughts and feedback!

Because she studied at ENS she was granted a job without having to do her PhD. BUT if she was to do it could she then use that qualification to teach here in the UK? 

Because she's lived in Tunisia all her life she doesn't qualify to apply for a student loan to study PhD here in UK (have to have resided in UK for 3 years minimum), in fact she will probably have to do her master's before applying for PhD in UK. 

This is a brief summary of what she's done so far.

Then I have Agregation in English American and Anglophone literature and Civilization 
And I have the Ecole Normale Certificate which shows that I've done Stage in TEFL.

I absolutely love my job, but I always like having options for later in life. Due to this conundrum, I've been very interested in pursuing a PhD. I am most passionate about Linguistics, but here are my concerns:

1) I don't have the safety net available where I can quit my job (which I also don't want to give up prematurely) to complete an in-person program.

2) There are very few esteemed online programs for Linguistics, especially at the doctoral level.

3) Most Linguistics programs require mastery of a second language, which is proving to be very difficult for my brain to accomplish.

4) The potential cost if I am not fortunate enough to earn full funding would close the door permanently because loans just aren't an option any longer.

I am in my 3rd year of my PhD program in education. I've got 1.5 years left. I have passed my comprehensive exams, which was an incredibly traumatic experience for me. During that month, I had went to urgent care twice and doctors twice and no one knew what was going on with me. Apparently the stress and anxiety was so bad that my body and brain were shutting down. I literally had to force myself to eat after I realized I hadn't ate in days. I could not sleep. I craved alcohol, which I had never craved in my life. I would blackout every time I would try to write my two papers. I had multiple migraines. I was on a plane at one point and hoped that the plane would crash. Multiple times while I was driving, I hoped that I would get into a terrible accident. Anything to escape the torture. These are just a few of the symptoms I was experiencing. I went into it with a very positive and motivated attitude, I was even excited to make it to this milestone, and it just did not end up well for me. This was in September, so about 4 months ago. I actually just pulled up one of my papers, and I legit do not remember writing ANY of it. It is like I was in a complete blackout. Now, I am really struggling to write my proposal. My advisor even said I have a really cool study, something that no one has done before, but every time I try to sit down and read or write, it is like my mind goes blank and I can't get anything done. I have thought about quitting and going into real estate investment, and I have a pretty good opportunity where I could make a lot, much more than the PhD, and that is probably playing into the motivation factor a little - but I was also experiencing the same thing with my coursework last semester after passing my comps, before real estate had entered the picture. The kicker is that I have a government-funded Leadership Grant - which I was funded for a year and a half, totaling at 54k, which would go on top of another big chunk of student loans (I have ZERO debt outside of student loans). I think that I could do very well in real estate, but it is so daunting to think of that 54k turning into a loan. I have to work full time for 36 months to complete my service obligation after I graduate. So I would be stuck in this field for another 4.5 years. I am passionate about what I am studying, but I see all of the academics I work under almost working like slaves - some 80 hours a week, most not happy, overly stressed, and that is something I have no desire to do or experience. I do not enjoy reading or writing, and I have come to enjoy it less and less as time goes on. I have ADHD pretty bad, so the reading and writing is just very difficult for me and my anxiety doesn't make it any better. I am just wondering if anyone out there has or knows anyone who has quit their program with funding that they had turned into loans. If they are happy now, or if it was a terrible decision.  I am starting an intensive therapy this week, 5 days a week for 3 months to try to work through this PTSD and get motivated. I just kind of feel like a failure. I have about 2 pages of my proposal written and I keep feeling like I JUST CAN'T DO IT. sigh. I don't know if it would be possible to claim disability from PTSD and get out of paying that grant back? I dunno. I'm looking for any kind of advice or direction here.

I've been in this dilemma for a while. I finished my Master's in Information System Technologies from Wilmington University, DE last summer(2018). I've been taking a break for a while. I am also an active duty military (enlisted) with no student loans. I have full GI bill, which I could use for pursuing Phd (part time) online, or local campus around San Diego, CA.

My questions are as follow:

1. Is it a good idea to use up post 9/11 GI bill for college while still on active duty?
2. I've been in military for last 10 years, should I just wait till I retire at 20 years, or should I get out right now to pursue Phd to reap full benefits of GI bill? If I join the school, they would only pay for tuition. However, if I get out, they will pay for housing as well.
3. Is Phd (in data science or similar field) even worth it?
4. I know this is r/PhD, so here is a biased question. Should I give up on idea of PhD and pursue commercial Pilot? I'm genuinely confused.

I don't think any university will fund a part time Phd.

In fact, what I am interested in is mathematical logic, rather than philosophy. However, my teachers thought I lack talent in doing pure logic.  They recommended me to continue philosophy learning and studying.  It seems good for me to follow what our teachers said because this can help me graduate smoothly.  However, I personally want to do what I really like. 

The trouble also lies in the money.  I do not have money.  This means I cannot apply for any other PhD positions that requires fee or just life expenditures.  I need a scholarship which is elusive to obtain for me because of my present knowledge and experience in mathematical logic.

I am a 3rd-year graduate student and I am concerned about my PhD trajectory. I was hoping to get insight on how to best proceed given all of your academic experiences.

To give you some background, I started my graduate school journey with a wonderful advisor. I feel truly blessed to have such a great and rare opportunity to train with a dedicated and supportive faculty member who is willing to mentor and train me to be the best scientist I can be. I completed my first year of graduate school in a PhD human factors program at a university with little to no faculty support within the department, so it was hard to find resources and also get help with statistics-related questions from faculty members. Because of the little support from the department, my advisor was offered a position in a new cluster at another university, and so I followed him to this new university, because I love his research and mentoring approaches. At this new university, there is a lot of support from faculty and many resources. I have already learned so much! However, I am concerned about my PhD trajectory, because upon transferring to this new university, there was no PhD program synonymous to the degree I am studying for, and so the dean promised to help create a new doctoral program for the college my advisor joined.

I have spent a year at this university now in a masters program and there has been a lot of push back from the administration about developing the new program which will take up to 3 years given everything is approved (which is where faculty are running into trouble as the program is very new and encapsulates a new field that this college is not traditionally used to). To give you more details, the program would involve data science (I think this would be the name) and we are in a department of education. If you do not know, the field of education is traditionally very siloed from other disciplines. While we do a lot of research in the field of education, we also do a lot of work with computer sciences, statistics, and psychology. We were promised an interdisciplinary PhD program. Given all of the pushback from the administration, we are in the process of creating a track to place the graduate students in (such as myself) to work towards the degree while it is being created.

My concern involves how long this could take. From the looks of it, I could be in graduate school for another 3+ years and I am a hard-working graduate student. I am pushing myself to write and publish as much as possible because I want to be done (the graduate salary is really pushing me to finish), but I cannot start my dissertation because there is no program. I am really discouraged to add on another 3+ years because there is no program... and I'm not sure which type of program it would even be (i.e., what type of degree I would be getting will depend on what is approved). Apparently, the administration suggested switching the program proposal from a PhD to an EdD program, which could get it approved faster... I'm really concerned as an EdD does not encapsulate the work I am doing which is heavily research-based and not at all curriculum focused...

I'm not sure what to do and whether I should stick it out. I cannot go another 3+ years making the salary I am because I cannot afford to live off of it and so I am still taking out student loans to pay all of my bills... I don't know whether switching to another program would be ideal (that would set me back even more because all of the work I've done over the last 3 years would be for nothing), master out, or continue trudging through the trenches of unknown. I am very discouraged at this point. I do not want to waste all of my hard work and time to not know where the end of the road is... I feel I should already be starting my dissertation at this point as well...

Please let me know what you think given your academic and graduate school experiences.

I'm in the final year of my funded 3 year PhD in the UK, though I'm nowhere near finishing. It's at a University where research was never the focus, and a large cohort of PhD students were brought in in order to improve their Research Excellence Framework scores. Unfortunately, the University didn't plan for things like where to put us as PhD students, office space, equipment etc, therefore I have only just received a suitable computer for my engineering based PhD in my final year. There are a number of other factors, such as the room and equipment needed to carry out the practical aspects of my research being completed and usable 18 months late, only being available a quarter of the way through my final year. As a cohort, everyone has experienced similar problems, as such, very few of us will complete and finish on time this Autumn. I'm one of the postgraduate student representatives, and no matter how many times or who we tell in senior management, nothing changes, nothing improves. Our university does not have a reduced writing fee for an extra year either, and as it stands, the will expect us to pay circa ¬£2000 for part time fees in order to extend our PhD's by a year. The delays in our progress are not our fault, we can't produce quality papers if we simply don't have access to equipment and space needed to conduct that research, and we're going to have to literally pay because of their managerial ineptitude. If they don't agree to waive the fees, I'm tempted to quit come my studentship end date. Has anyone got any advice for battling an institution drowned in bureaucracy?

I have an MBA and just finished an MS in Information Technology Management in December.  I am considering applying for a PhD program in Systems Engineering and Management.  It is an online program with 2 two week residency requirements, one in each of the first two years of coursework.

I have a full time job in telecommunications and I am Director level.  I know that I will not get a pay increase upon achieving my PhD.  In fact, I may hurt my chances for advancement in my current company and while I am completing my PhD, the process may come across as a distraction while I try to advance my career.

My work will pay for this degree.  There will be no personal funds spend, no student loans accrued.  If I was to spend my own money, I would not attempt this.  

There are a lot of reasons why this would be a bad idea.  I have a stressful job and I travel 40% or so.  I can find a ton of people that will tell me that I am crazy and that I shouldn't do it.  Not sure that my wife is even a fan of the idea.

All that said, I am very good at school.  I earned an MBA and a STEM MS while working full time with minimal time investment.  I learn very fast and I am very efficient.  All qualities that add up in my favor when contemplating taking this leap.  I know that a PhD is not even in the same ballpark as far as workload goes with an MBA or an MS, but I am really good at school.  I think that traveling will be an asset to me as I have a ton of downtime on the road at the hotel, free from the distractions of wife and kids.  I can leave the office at 5 and go back to the hotel and do work.

Bottom line, I want this PhD for personal achievement.  I want to learn and master the Systems Engineering space.  I want to add to the industry through rigorous research and find new answers to existing problems.  I don't mind people telling me that I am stupid for working towards a PhD when I have an MBA, an MS, a PMP, and an awesome, high paying job.

I managed to get a scholarship from my university, but it only covers my tuition fees and some of my accommodation fees, but not all of them let alone living costs like food etc.

I've not managed to get funding from anywhere else, so I was going to get a loan from the government. I currently have an undergraduate loan and a masters loan, and I discovered that if you get a PhD loan it gets added to your masters loan. So essentially, either way I'll have two loans to pay back, it's just I'd be paying back one for longer if I get a PhD loan out.

To me, this doesn't seem like a terrible option on the basis the loan is paid back according to your income, so it's essentially a tax rather than a loan. As such, I'll basically just have to factor it in to my monthly budget when I start paying it back. In fact, it'll just come straight out of my pay cheque each month like any other tax. It also has the benefit of me not being financially dependent on my family. I see my PhD as my choice, and having my family pay for my living costs seems unfair to me. 

But I've heard from a lot of people (both in this sub and people I've spoken to in academia) that you shouldn't get a loan for a PhD and that you should make sure you're paid. How realistic is this though? I understand and agree with the sentiment, but the field I'm in doesn't really lend itself to funding. My course starts in a few weeks, and I don't feel able to take a year out to look for other funding options. Do any of you have any advice on this, or getting funding in general?

42,42,Helping PhD graduates find a job,3,7yrug1,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7yrug1/helping_phd_graduates_find_a_job/,7,"What I Did to Get a Job in the Worst Economy Since the Great Depression

This article tells you some about my story and about a little trick I did to help me get a job at a good university, a job I still have today. I really think this still applies today, academia or industry. 

Let me tell you a little about myself. I was doing an initial job search near the end of my PhD, which was at the end of 2008 going into 2009. At the time the stock market had plummeted in value, with most companies freezing their hiring processes, or doing major layoffs. This was a bad time overall to find a job. I always did well in school, and excelled in many aspects. I received scholarships, fellowships, and research assistantships and was happily on my way to getting a great job, I thought, even with the gloom of the economy at the time. 

My logic was that as a BS or MS student I already received job offers at prestigious organizations with a decent salary so surely after graduating with my doctorate I was going to get a great job. Wow after some initial searching, I was starting to realize that I may not get the job of your dreams, or even worse no job.

Sure graduating with my doctorate made me an expert in a particular area, but I started to question how valuable my expertise was in the marketplace. Unfortunately I was I‚Äôll prepared for my job search, for the potential disappointments that came along, and for the fierce competition. I had pressing student loan debt and things started to get tight. I‚Äôm the kind of person that even if I have time in front of me, if I don‚Äôt have a plan, panic starts to settle in. 

As a doctoral student I was the opposite of being socially adept and able to connect with those around me. Being good at my field didn‚Äôt necessarily, or completely prepare me, for the competition I was going to face. One thing I learned right away was that the social aspect and communicating my ideas was almost as important as the actual subject, papers, and projects I had worked on. Sure my CV (curriculum vitae) was solid but as long as I was a weirdo I was doomed to never get a decent job. 

So what do I recommend as a starting point for getting some traction on your first job? Call someone, on the phone, not an email, not a text, not a Facebook message. To me, picking up the phone and calling someone gave me so much fear that I could hardly stand it. What would I say, what if they could hear my voice shaking, what if I didn‚Äôt know the answers to their questions? 

To be really honest, none of that mattered much but I made it to be something so big in my head it paralyzed me. But after a few experiences I quickly learned that I needed to connect with someone outside of the interview, know the process before I even set foot on-site, or even before I submitted my application packet. 	

You may ask yourself now, are you serious? This doesn‚Äôt work anymore today. If I call I will only have access to the secretary or the HR person and they will just tell me to apply online anyway. And I agree that you will have to apply online. But what I‚Äôm advising is that you try to get a person to look at your resume first, talk with you, put a voice to the name. This will greatly increase your chances of getting a job. Applying online without human contact can feel like you‚Äôre lost in cyberspace, with most applications going unanswered.  

After I prepared my CV, I starting calling people. But wait who did I call? What the did I say? You can imagine that some conversations didn‚Äôt last long, I wasn‚Äôt able to get a hold of the right person, but in many cases I was able to. I was persistent. 

An important thing to remember is that most of the people you will be calling are fine people that are wanting great candidates that show diligence and persistence. You won‚Äôt be bothering them, most of these folks are receptive to talk (but don‚Äôt take a tremendous amount of their time, they are busy). 

Once I was able to get a hold of a manager, engineer, or scientist that held information about the job I was applying to, I got information about the interview process, information about who was in charge, even some unsolicited interviews. 

One of the keys of this method is to be persistent and find the right person to call. After a few clicks on the web, it is possible to find the phone number of many of the people in charge or that may hire you. Keep in mind that, yes they will ask you to apply online, but I think it is so important to try to talk to someone before applying.  

As a starting point look online, think of someone you met at a recruiting event of the company, even a friend. Call their number and start asking questions. It is so important that you prepare for this conversation. You don‚Äôt want to completely cold call a company, you want to at least familiarize yourself with the purpose of the company, the job description you‚Äôre interested in, what they sell, how big are they, are you a fit at all for the work they do there, where are they located, if they‚Äôre publicly traded how big are they, etc. 

What do you say?: Let me give you a starting point. If you get nervous like me follow the script below, literally read it and fill in the blanks as you go along. Keep in mind, if you get the person‚Äôs administrative assistant ask to speak with them, schedule an appointment to speak with them, or ask if they have any information on who they may recommend that you speak with instead. 

You: Hi my name is Jane Bane and I graduated with my PhD in mechanical engineering from Awesome University in Fall of 20XX. I‚Äôm looking for employment at ABC. 

Person on the phone: What kind of work are you looking for?

Person on the phone: Well this is the structures division, that type of work is not done here

You: Would you please give me the phone number of someone in the Propulsion or Thermal Management division?

It has been 1.5 years since I joined my PhD at a University and I love the kind of research that is happening here and been gaining lot of exposure.

I have recently read about a PhD position and had the urge to apply for it for mainly 2 reasons.

1. It is time bound (3 years)  and more project/objective oriented compared to my current PhD wherein it might take at least another 4.5 years to complete and also the exact topic in which I will work on is not yet defined.

2. The stipend they are offering(2000 EU) is nearly 6 times the stipend I get in my current university (which is around 350 Eu). I have been paying my educational loan that I took from my Masters but I guess it will take at least another 5 years for me to settle this debt.

I have now been called for an interview at this university and I need some tips on answering one particular question which is ""why leave this PhD and join another"".

In field B, publications don't really matter much in PhD admissions. I was also at a top 10 institution for field B as an undergrad. I applied to 8 schools, got rejected by 6 and waitlisted by 2 top 20 programs.

I decided to take a year off and do some research in order to write a better writing sample, which I did. Everyone told me that was the main weakness of my application.

My classes were definitely a bit difficult, the students without backgrounds in business had catch-up courses which were more or less unhelpful - tons of material crammed into a couple weeks of classes, it's a miracle I passed those classes - and now 2nd semester we realized that we didn't learn some key concepts for microeconomics that we should've learned doing the catch-up.

I'm not super clear on the standards of French grading, I was always under the impression that a 12/20 was maybe equivalent to a B- in the US. But the school I go to is essentially for the highest-achieving French & Europeans, I feel really out of place both socioeconomically and with my academic background. I had difficultly focusing during undergrad plus I was working part time for the majority of my studies, and I graduate with only a 2.9. Somehow I got into this great school, and I was so confident that I could turn things around and study hard. I did study, but inefficiently, and with five exams in one week and one the week prior, I was unable to adequately prepare for any of them. I have just received my grades and I failed 2 classes and got poor grades (less than 15/20 in 2 of them) in the other three. My overall GPA is only 13.5/20. Now we are supposed to be searching for internships and I don't know how I will find one considering I have no prior professional experience, super bad grades, and mediocre foreign language skills. I'm this close to telling my parents what happened (I never told them how bad my undergrad grades were) but I can't think of any situation where telling them would be helpful to me - it would just lead to more nagging and them worrying about me more. This school is expensive by French standards and it's coming out of my pocket via loans too.

&#x200B;

I have resits for the exams in two weeks thankfully. But this had been a major blow to my confidence. I'm one of only a few native English speakers in the program and older than the average student and still I performed so poorly. I'm really not sure how I can recover and be successful in this situation. I've tried so hard to improve my studying strategies and I still feel like I not only don't understand how to study effectively, but I can never remember anything and I get overwhelmed and want to quit easily. I'm not sure if my school has resources such as an academic counselor, at least not the type we're used to in the US. Last term (was at a different campus) there was a general counselor and when I told her how I was struggling in my classes and having difficulty motivating myself to study, she reacted somewhat in shock and with some scorn and basically told me ""you need to start studying! You don't have much time left before exams!"". So many of my classmates come from privileged backgrounds and are very high-achieving and can't fathom grades as poor as mine.",1580587049.0
2,2,Paying off $200k in student loan in 3.5 years- experience from a pharmacy graduate,10,74v8ks,study,https://www.reddit.com/r/study/comments/74v8ks/paying_off_200k_in_student_loan_in_35_years/,2,"*-A guide in loan refinancing and smart tactics to pay off debt-*

**About the Author:**
Prior to my graduation from pharmacy school in 2013, I spent months reading up on the many ways people have paid off their student debt.  I pieced together what they have all done and applied to my personal debt.  Follow me on my detailed journey to my loan repayment and use this to help you get over yours.  I paid off $200k student debt (and a new car worth $25.5k) in a little under 3 and ¬Ω years.

**Recommendation to loan repayment 2017:**
*-straight to the point-*
If I was a graduate in 2017 with $300k loan, here is what I would do:
1) Leave the loan with your current lender, don't consolidate yet (you have 6 months grace period).  Choose income based repayment.
2) Work as much as you can, pay all you can towards the highest loan % and make sure to ask that your payments go towards the interest.
3) Do this until January 2018.   When you file your taxes for 2017, you will get form 1098E- which shows interest paid on your student loan. 
4) Since you worked as pharmacist only half of the year, you will qualify to have all your interest payments deducted from your taxes.  Your income tax return will be very high.  Use it to pay off your loans, don't spend it!  -Since you know this in advance, you can set your tax exemptions when you start working so that little tax is withheld.  This way, you keep more money per paycheck, and will allow you to make bigger monthly payments towards your loans-
5) After the 6 months grace period, consider loan consolidation.  Either SOFI, DRB, First Republic Bank, CommonBond are good options.  Apply for all and go with the best rate.  *see below*
6) In addition to paying the minimum, make sure you send all your ‚Äúextra‚Äù money each month towards your loan.  Bring it down for another 5-6 months and refinance again.  Apply to all your options and go with the lowest interest rate.
7) By now, hopefully your rate is around 4.5%.  Use your savings from loan-refinancing to pay off your loan faster.  Get to where you are at $0 net worth (debt to income ratio is close to 1)
8) Once your loan is around $100k, apply to First Republic Bank if you are living in the West Coast.  If you qualify, you will get a rate of 1.99% for 5 years loan.  If you are in the East, look into other banks around your area.   Contact them and ask about student loan refinancing.  By now, your record of loan payments and credit score are impressive and  you should easily qualify.
9) Don‚Äôt believe me?  This is too easy to be true?  Follow me on my journey to paying off my debt!

-    Notice I had 6 months loan payment deferment- I didn‚Äôt have to make payments until 2/6/2014.  At which point, my minimum payments were $523 for Grad Plus and $863 for Stafford Loan.   Whenever I had extra money, I dumped it into my grad plus.

**Tip:**
1) Pay the most towards your highest interest loan.  Most of your money will go to reducing on the interest, in which it will become tax deductible for that year (since you make so little in your first year, this can be deducted.).  On 4/6/14 and 4/24/14  I received my tax refunds and applied all  ($10k) towards the loan.
2) Reduce your cost of living!  This is the best way to save more money so that you can apply to your loans.  An example of my living expenses in 3/1/2015, 10 months after graduation:
  Grad Loan: $523   
  Stafford Loan: $863
  Car loan: $828
  House rent: $500
  Family support: $500
  Car Insurance: $144
  Gas: $160
  Food: $600
  Total expenses: $4100
  Net income after taxes: $6000 

  -As you can see, I didn‚Äôt have to eat beans and rice to make this work.  I bought a new car, shared a 3 bedroom apartment with 2 other friends, helped out my family, and still had $2000 a month to dump into the loans.  Not to mention, I worked at least 30 hrs overtime/month initially to build up my cash reserve (read more to find out). 

**Stable job, stable life:**

At this point in my life, everything seemed financially stable.  I wanted to look into ways to pay off my student loans faster.  I started to realize the repayment process was too slow due to interest rates being so high.  A friend of mine has talked about student loan refinancing upon graduation-but I never really look into it.  On 10/16/2014, I did my research and I applied thru SOFI.  It was a quick and very simple process, all done online and papers submitted via pdf.  I felt like I had enough of my loans paid off to receive good rates.  I refinanced $162,565 with interest rate of 5.49% with automatic monthly payments.   (DRB was also a good option, read more to find out).

5/8/2015                          1780       142,041

**Tip:** After you refinance away from the government lender into a private lender, the biggest risk is that you no longer have the option to request payment deferment due to difficulties or hardships that prevent you from making minimum monthly payments.  To deal with this, you should save up an emergency fund of about 6 months cost of living.  This is in case you lose your job or you get injured or sick and you cannot work, you have at least this time to recoup.  The more time you may need, the more months of savings you should have.  I personally had $10k in emergency fund at all times. 

**My next biggest move:**
After being with SOFI for a period of time, I felt like I have built enough of a credit history to request a better rate.  I could‚Äôve stayed with SOFI and refinanced thru them but I decided to switch to DRB since they offered me a better rate at the time.  DRB (aka Laurel Road) offered competitive rates and the application process was as simple as SOFI‚Äôs- both were very great and reliable companies.  It took less than a month from start of refinance application to getting the loans funded.

5/2/2016                      84,750

Tip: Don‚Äôt settle for minimum payments- I rarely did.  Since the rates were so high, I wanted to reduce my principal as fast as I could so that I can reapply for refinancing and get a more competitive rate, at which point I would pay the minimum and save my money for future investments.

**My biggest achievement:**
After a year with DRB, I recognized that I have built myself a very good credit history.  Furthermore, my debt burden is equal to my current assets ‚Äì my net worth is essentially $0.  Although this sounds sad, it actually is something to brag about.  From this point on, I will build my wealth, paycheck to paycheck.  I will be of financial worth!  This was a big achievement, and I wanted to be rewarded somehow.  That's when I found First Republic Bank.  This company was strict in which it accepts its applicants: 1) only lend to folks who live near their branches- in California, New York City, Boston, Greenwich CT, Portland OR, and Palm Beach FL,  2) must not have too much debt burden compared to income, 3) good credit score, 4) good payment history.  I have achieved all these, and I was qualified!

...                  ...

**Debt Free, Financial Freedom:**
If you notice, I am still paying my student loan.  So how can I say I have no debt when I am still paying my student loan?  Because ever since I was with First Republic, I paid the monthly minimum and have been saving- I did not make extra payments.  Why?  Because at 1.99%, the rate is so low that I am better off doing something else with my money.  I have some in the stock market, and the rest in a 1.2% savings account.  Therefore, as of 1/9/2017, I am debt free- I have enough money to pay off my loan but instead wish not to pay it off.  I am saving for my next adventure, owning a home.

**Fin:**
If there is anything I can shed light on, dont hesitate to ask.  I am here to make your loan repayment as painless as possible.  I‚Äôve been thru this, and I know you can too!

A fund for the fishery, aquaculture development & animal husbandry will be set up with a total corpus to be Rs 10,000 crore. We will also allocate Rs 1290 crore for a bamboo mission, as it is green gold.
In all, we are providing Rs 10 lakh crore to Rs 11 lakh crore as credit for agricultural activities.

The government will establish a dedicated affordable housing fund.
Loans to self-help groups will increase to Rs75,000 crore.
Govt. allocated Rs5,750 crore to National Livelihood Mission & Rs2,600 crore to the groundwater irrigation scheme.

End of sample. Sorry if it looks cramped. 

I've checked methods like sq3r and suggestions like read the material and then read the same again next day and revise again to remember it well.

0,0,(UK) My boyfriend had a depressive episode and now the Uni won't give him his loan.,7,g939z4,Student,https://www.reddit.com/r/Student/comments/g939z4/uk_my_boyfriend_had_a_depressive_episode_and_now/,0,"So my bf is studying at a college with the OU. Back in January he took a lot of time off because he was in a really bad place mentally. He had had constant communication with his tutor about this however at this time he wasn't submitting any work. 

When he was ready to come back to the uni he got papers from the doctor to confirm his diagnosis and treatment (as the uni had asked him to do). He contacted his tutor again who told him everything would be fine he just needed to submit ONE ASSIGNMENT. He then contacted student finance as he had noticed that he hadn't received his loan when he was supposed to. THEY informed him that he was no longer enrolled on a course and he wont be receiving any more payments. The uni had removed him from the course and simply didnt tell him. He contacted his tutor and was told that  if he submitted certain pieces of work that he would be put back on the course and could start receiving finance again.

 To summarise, he was told he needed to submit 1 assignment and that he was still on his course and everything was fine, he was then informed by someone other than the uni that he was in fact removed from the course, his tutor then told him he has to submit 3 assignments to be put back on despite what he had previously said.  My boyfriend did the work he had to do and sent it off. His tutor vanished for 2 weeks and ignored all the emails. During this time my bf was receiving eviction letters as he had missed his rent payment. 

When the tutor finally responded he told my bf that he now has to do more work if he wants to receive his finance. My boyfriend is having to decide between having food or having electricity. I'm helping him out financially and putting myself into debt so he doesn't starve. His family receive very little from the work that do and his mum has 2 other kid to look after. They help when they can. He has been looking for work for the past month or so but he's had no replies. 

This has all caused him to relapse into another depressive episode. He understands that he needs to complete his work to get paid but he's really struggling to get anything done now due to constant hunger and depression. I dont feel like the uni have any right to hold him at ransom like this. He is starving himself and has received more eviction notices. His tutor lied to him about his situation and lied to him about being removed from the course. He also lied about the amount of work he needs to do to get put back on the course. Every time he submits something he has to submit something else to receive his money. He's now missed 2 student fiance payments. Is there any sort of legal action he can take or are the uni within their rights to do this?",1588031528.0

&nbsp;

Example: A student needs $10k for a semester (or coding bootcamp). They go to a financier and get $10k upfront structured as debt. If the student doesn't graduate they're required to pay back the principal plus interest as if it were a standard loan. If the student does graduate the principal plus interest converts into an income share agreement where the financier is entitled to X% of the former student's income over a specified period of time.

&nbsp;

It's better than a loan for students because there's no defined principal that they have to pay down if they graduate. It's better than an income share agreement for investors because if the student doesn't graduate the dispersed funds are still treated as a loan.

I want to pursue a PhD in linguistics. It is on track with what I enjoy most in life. I‚Äôm not doing it necessarily because it will lead me to have a high paying job or make me the smartest person in the world. I want to do it because it‚Äôs something I love and an area of academia I want to contribute to. I study Mandarin and have reached a decent level just studying it on my own, but have also taken a year of it in University. I currently have an Associates In Arts with pretty much every open credit possible to take filled with Foreign Languages. I have a 3.5 GPA, and don‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôll have much trouble getting into an undergrad program for Linguistics. Ideally I will double major in linguistics and Chinese, then go into grad school with research emphasis on adult language acquisition. I‚Äôm aware that tenure track positions aren‚Äôt really a thing anymore in the humanities sector for linguistics especially. However, I would like to pursue teaching of Chinese as a foreign language or even TEFL at a university level abroad, as many eastern and European countries have positions available for doctoral degree earners. I am hoping having an undergrad emphasis on Chinese will also lead to opportunities in the United States for teaching it at a college level as well. 
So herein lies my dilemma: no university in my state offers an undergrad or doctoral study in linguistics or Chinese. I have many universities I am interested in, but all will result in me being $40k or more in debt due to out of state tuition. Thankfully all of the schools I am looking at fully fund their PhD programs with a living stipend so I won‚Äôt need to worry about tuition past undergrad, but I am incredibly worried (especially given the current climate with COVID19) about going into that much debt. 

My only solution I‚Äôve come up with is to move to the city and state where I want to go to school for a year (which actually May end up happening anyway due to covid 19) and take a year off to declare residency and establish myself as a citizen.

I started my Associates Degree in the USA as an International student. I pay around 6000 dollars for one semester. My parent support me but I did not tell them yet that the amount for the university will be much higher. I probably will pay 14.000-20.000 for one semester at a State University in California. I am working next to my studies but this makes me only afford the community college. Originally, I planned to only to my AA but figured out that I am not really learning anything and the courses are so easy, more like High School level compared to the High school I finished in Europe. Furthermore, I figured out that Associates Degrees are meaningless in Europe and the job market wont be too good in America for immigrants for the next view months or years. 

The first question would be: If I only do an Associates Degree how likely is it to get a job/internship in the US or in Europe after graduation?

Second of all, if I continue to do my Bachelors in the US, do you think it will be worth it? My degree is Psychology and I do not plan to become a therapist. I would like to work in the marketing or HR field. My grades are all A-B. 

I could get this whole education for free in Europe and I am thinking about going back. Yet, I love the US and I see myself living here. It would be hard to leave but the burden on my parents is very high. Although they both earn very well, they are planing to retire in a view years and will need the money for themselves.

I never put my all into school because I never made school my top priority. In 2017 I came straight out of High school and thrown into college so fast. I remember specifically telling my mom that I wanted to TAKE A SEMESTER BREAK before I start my first year in college. Well that didn't happen because she told me the same old bullshit I hear all the time which is ""but you might not come back"". She gave me no if ands or buts and told me I had no other choice. 

Welp, my first year in college DID NOT go so well. I failed that whole year. I was put on fasfa retention, academic probation, you name it. Fast-forward  to now I'm 3 years into my university and I'm still a sophomore. I don't even know how i made it this far. I half assed my whole way through every semester. Barely passing classes with a C. You're probably wondering why I even pursued that much time into college if I don't like it. When I say I had no other choice, I meant I had no OTHER choice. I was threatened with my living spaces (i dont live on campus) if I didn't go and I felt like college was my only choice since I'm not one of those lucky people who either came into money or just magically lucky in life. 

I recently found out that I have SEVERE depression, mild anxiety, and stress so high into the danger zone. When I found this out, i was shocked. I didn't want to be put on medicine so I decided to go with counseling. I'm not going to make it this semester. I'm barely going to classes and I'm not doing any of the work. I tried to withdraw from all my classes two weeks ago because I knew this semester was not going to end well for me. Well I was given the same advice from my adviser ""but you might not come back"" and was told that withdrawing was a bad idea and that I should pursue on. I have no more energy left for school right now. I am mentally fried and I'm wasting time. I really don't know what to do. Plus I have no passion for anything and I know I'm not going to find it through constantly stressing about school. Especially since my mental health is in its worst state it's ever been.

I'm an undergrad Electrical Engineering major about to finish my second semester and thus my first year of university.  However, due to some personal reasons, I've decided I want to transfer out of this major program and into another one that I'm more parrionate about and that I think fits me better: Philosophy. My parents have expressed their dissatisfaction with my decision, telling me that if I decide to switch out of engineering that they will no longer be willing to support me financially. I understand their decision, and I also understand that I will have to work a lot harder personally to make this decision work (i.e. take loans, work-study, multiple jobs, etc.), but I've resolved myself to this decision.

Have any of you guys experienced the same thing and, if so, do you guys have any tips? Right now I'm most concerned about paying for my next semester's tuition and housing, which I know I will almost certainly have to take out loans for. Anything helps!

Edit: I feel I should add this here to clarify something: My current career plan is to get a bachelor's degree in Philosophy with a minor in Educational Psych, get certified to teach in my state, and work full-time as a teacher (potentially with other part-time work) as I save up for and eventually enter grad school. My ultimate pursuit is Philosophy academia, which I will need at least a Master's for, maybe even a PhD, but that's my plan as of now.

I‚Äôm a 20 year old Junior at a tech institute studying Management Information Systems. I‚Äôm realizing that college is not for me, as I have Borderline Personality Disorder and also a big hatred for my school. My school is responsible for me not receiving a very important internship, and billed me $2700 for trying to move out of campus housing that was growing black mold and has asbestos (no idea what my legal options are there).

I‚Äôm currently 100k in debt ( middle class family, bad luck with financial aid), and I want out of my tech school. I‚Äôm good at my focus in my major, Database Management Systems, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the path I want to take.

There‚Äôs a community college nearby that I haven‚Äôt really looked into yet, but I‚Äôm not sure what degrees I could get there that could pay off my debt.

I‚Äôm basically asking if there‚Äôs a way out or if I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve never explored options other than university because my parents and teachers pushed me into it and convinced me it was the only way I‚Äôd have a happy/successful life (I used to be very trusting/oblivious/naive). I‚Äôd be willing to go to a community college, but like I said I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any jobs that pay high enough to live with my debt.

I am currently a sophomore at New York University. I like it here, but honestly don‚Äôt love it as much as I had thought. 

Recently, NYU has reduced my academic scholarship and taken away a scholarship I was given freshman year. After doing the math on what I have saved for college left, I am looking at approximately $75,000-$80,000 in student loans if I continue at NYU for the next two years and graduate here.

My other option is to transfer to Rutgers in New Brunswick. Since I am in state, tuition will only be $15,000 annually. I have two friends from home who are also transferring to Rutgers next year (from our local community college) and they said they would be down to rent an apartment with me. All in all, I am looking at about $20,000 - $25,000 in student loans if I transfer to Rutgers for my Junior and Senior year.

I am a Computer Science major and a Japanese Language minor. I have talked to many people about what I should do, and I have heard a wide range of responses. Some say that it is essentially a no-brainer, but I have quite a few others telling me that the networking, connections, and name recognition of NYU are worth the extra debt in the long run.

I am a HS senior with a cumulative GPA of 3.8 and have applied to several colleges for Nursing. I decided a few weeks ago that I should save money to prevent myself from obtaining too much student debt. Ever since I told them that I applied to a community college, my mother and my grandmother have been nagging me to change my college of choice. I was already pressured to take on a major of their choice and now they also want to control where I go. My mother is threatening me that she won‚Äôt pay for my tuition or any other college fees at all. My grandmother believes that I‚Äôll never be able to transfer out of cc (using her friends‚Äô children‚Äôs bad experience in a cc as an example). They have also made me do counseling/ info sessions with other (private) schools that require heavy tuition fees. By that point, it felt as if they‚Äôd rather have me in debt right after college than attend a cc. Once my grandmother realized that I have no plans to budge away from my decision, she started calling my parents more frequently telling them that I won‚Äôt gain a degree out of cc. My mother in turn got angry from her persistent calling and started berating me for my choices, calling me a disappointment and that I should just go ahead and get married. My brother calls me stupid every time he sees me and my dad obviously took my mother and my grandmother‚Äôs side the whole time. These past few weeks have been suffocating me greatly. I love my family but I‚Äôve never felt so so alone. I am planning to show them that they‚Äôre wrong but I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôll be able to survive the next 2 years without being called a failure and be constantly compared to my cousins who went straight to 4 year universities.

EDIT: Most of the schools I applied to (and got accepted) are private colleges and cal states far from home.

the thing is, college is fr*cking expensive. in my Niche list, it's not uncommon to see universities where cost of attendance is over $60k per year! in all fairness, most of my choices are out of state, but even looking in Maryland it's not really that cheap.

i hope to have at least an okay-ish job out of college and i know that there are millions of people who get out of college just fine and i could be overthinking it, but then it's no lie that millions struggle w/ paying back their loans and it's financially terrible for them.

For the longest time I thought I wanted to become an ultrasound tech after looking more into it I found out I can become certified in ultrasound, mri, x-ray, and ct in under 5 years. I thought this would be great and open a lot of decent pay career options. However I‚Äôm not a big people person and I have social anxiety. Nor am I really passionate about radiology. It‚Äôs also a hard field to get into. I just thought they were high paying easy jobs. 

So I changed my mind to becoming a nursing major then early childhood, then English but none of them feel right. I was searching reddit for people in similar situations as me and one guy said he became a software engineer because of its stress to pay level. In the comments they started talking about coding and how great the field was. I remembered the coding class I took in high school. While it doesn‚Äôt ignite a spark in me I didn‚Äôt hate it. So I started looking into computer science. I was reminded about the test they made you take in school to find out which careers are best for you and I always got web designer, fashion designer, interior designer. I really like designing and creating things like PowerPoints and other computer projects too. I was also really good at it. So now I‚Äôm thinking about becoming an app or website designer.

However, when I started trying to teach myself how to code I wasn‚Äôt that passionate about it, but I didn‚Äôt hate it.

Because I live in America I can‚Äôt just try out a bunch of things. My biggest fear is leaving college with a mountain of debt. The only thing I have really been passionate about is philosophy, but that‚Äôs a useless degree unless I want to go to law school or do marketing (which I don‚Äôt).

I have applied to eight schools and have been accepted to seven of them. I have gotten some great merit scholarships from a few schools. However, the problem is that I don't think that I am emotionally ready for college. The thought of going absolutely terrifies me. I have had serious anxiety attacks from thinking about this. I have a few reasons for why I feel this way.   


1. I don't know what I want to do in college. I know that every college student changes their major at least once in college, but I would feel HORRIBLE about going to college my first year and not putting that tuition money to good use. It seems like a waste.
2. The transition is too much for me. It takes a while for me to adjust to my surroundings and being forced into a new area all of a sudden to fend for myself would be anxiety-inducing and terrible for my mental health.
3. Reaclimating into a normal school environment after 3+ years of online school would be an adjustment.
4. I just don't want to be away from my family yet. I know that this is a stupid reason, but it is one of the main reasons why I don't want to go. 
5. A majority of colleges that I have applied to are super far from home, but that is expected based on where I live. This didn't settle in until I started going on college tours.

I feel horrible for feeling like this. It should be an easy decision, but I have AGONIZED over this for a few days now. I just feel like I would be a disappointment to my family for deciding on going to CC.

69,69,Really Stressed and Torn At the moment,3,g2rhzx,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/g2rhzx/really_stressed_and_torn_at_the_moment/,2,"   Whats up fellow college students. Im about to write something that might turn out to be really long so bear with me here. I'll try to keep it concise. 

&#x200B;

Here's the background info. So i'm wrapping up my first year of college at Nova Southeastern, a smaller school in South Florida. I'm in this program called Dual Admissions D.O, which is basically something that ""reserves"" you a spot in osteopathic medical school so long as you meet their gpa and mcat requirements. Nova's a private school, so even with about 25k per year in scholarships (including Bright Futures 100% scholarship) I still pay roughly 10-12k per semester. 

&#x200B;

Now here's the issue. I don't want to be a doctor, and I was pushed into this by my family. A common occurrence I know. However, the thing is my family knows about my disdain for medical professions. I'm a finance major and I have my real estate license. They're cool with all that, they just want me to get my medical degree for ""safety"" and then they say I can do whatever I want. Their reasoning is that if anything goes wrong in finance or real estate I won't lose everything because doctors always make a ton of money no matter what's happening in the economy, and if all else fails i can start a clinic or work at a hospital or something. The thing is, they're not necessarily wrong and I get that. 

&#x200B;

So I took chem, my first required science class, in my first semester. And i was doing so badly I withdrew. The Dual Admit program requires an average science gpa of 3.5 or higher. If you don't do that you get academic probation and if by the end of the next semester you still don't have a 3.5 you get booted from the program. I'm currently taking chem and although i started off doing better, I did awful on my last test and i've fallen off track. I need an a minus (85%) to avoid academic probation. I've fallen to a 72%. I need to do well on the final to get anywhere near the 85, and it's not looking great. The coronavirus distraction didn't help at all. My dad at the moment is happy and proud of me, but he has no idea what's really going on. If i end up on academic probation i'll be in deep trouble. 

&#x200B;

I'm currently doing well in all my other classes, and I'd have a high gpa without chem. However I don't really care much about school, even the accounting and econ classes. I just do what I need to do to get the A without really trying to pay attention to the lectures. I spend all day watching videos and reading books about the real estate market, the stock market, and personal finance. I also attend all the virtual classes that my real estate company does. It's not that I don't like to learn. But something about being in class just makes me want to be anywhere else. I can't sit still. I still want to get my bachelors and i have NO plans to dropout whatsoever, but I don't want to get a finance degree from an expensive school like Nova when I couldve studied at UCF, stayed in my home city, and pursued a real estate career which I feel has at least some potential.

&#x200B;

Thing is, I have so many things on my mind at once that sometimes my brain can't decide what to do, shuts down, and i just end up doing nothing. I'm currently trying to work on my real estate business in the middle of a pandemic. I've got work in my accounting and econ classes that is really important to complete to keep my grades good, and then there's all this chem work and studying that needs to get done if i want to stay afloat. I have no idea what to focus on, everythings just in my face all at once. If the distraction of D.O. was gone, it would be a massive weight off my shoulders.

&#x200B;

Now, what I would do if i could is transfer to UCF, in my hometown of Orlando. I could do my finance degree, won't have to worry about science classes that I have no drive to complete, and I could focus on building my future in real estate at the same time. Also bright futures would mean that I would pay nothing. In my senior year of high school UCF also offered me their most prestigious scholarship ON TOP of bright futures, since I was in the top ten percent of my high school class. I would be paying nothing for school, be close to home, and be able to focus on the projects that matter to ME. 

&#x200B;

I'm really certain that doing that would make things so much easier for me. But my dad would be so angry at me for leaving the ""blessing"" of this ""guaranteed"" medical program, and he's already put thousands of dollars into this school. I would feel completely ungrateful and wasteful if i left. But that's a sunk cost fallacy, and I'm honestly not confident in my drive to complete chem 2, organic chem, physics, biochem, and then do ANOTHER 4 years of med school. But i just cringe so hard when i think of what might happen if i leave the ""safety"" of a medical degree to pursue real estate and finance. If things don't go as my mind envisions, I could end up struggling in life and my family could say ""I told you so"".

The Air Force has a minimum requirement contract of 4 years Active Duty. I will be a senior in college this fall and I do not want to keep going in debt, currently around $40,000 in debt and it will be around 50-60k this year if I sign another loan. I have weighed the pros and cons, and it will allow me to start a fresh chapter in my life. Being at home sucks and I do not like living with my parents. The job market is getting worse, and rather than working in a crappy job while living at home (probably retail, factory work, or fast food), I will be working in the Air Force while they pay for my housing, food, and other expenses. The US Military budget is BIG, and I can see why it is huge because all of these things are paid for by the government. Also my interest rate will lower from 9% to 6% which will lower my expected monthly payments. Above all, if anything doesn't go to plan, my dad makes 90K a year so we aren't a poor family. And my grandpa is currently 88 years old and he has $2million in retirement so if he passes away (i do not intend to wish death upon anyone) then that is a life-changer financially for me and my family with debt.

My proposed life-plan is to enlist in the Air Force as potentially an E3 or E4 in Fall 2020 (or Spring 2020 if classes do not go online for my school), do basic military training which lasts 8.5 weeks. Then after BMT, all Airmen go to Air Force Tech School to learn their job function and attend classes (will take a couple-few months), all while in the process I get paid 30K a year so I can pay off my loans in 2-3 years before I step down from the Air Force. Then after the Air Force I plan ,on first finishing my bachelor's in Finance if its not already done, then get an MBA in 2 years while working at a job related in my field or whatever I can get at the time, then after that only time can tell what happens. I wouldn't mind If i get deployed, most Air Force airmen do not see combat and there is no Infantry for the Air Force, and you get to travel.  There are people that say the biggest downfalls of the military is not seeing your loved ones. But I am currently single, have no kids, and I kinda have a bad/distant relationship with my family (its complicated) so that will work in my favor. 4 years is not a long time in the grand scheme of things, and I plan on living to be 80-100 years old. When I realize this, I always think about how my current crappy circumstances in life are only temporary, and there are wide long roads ahead of me in the next 10, 15+ years.

&#x200B;

I will encourage more people to join the Military if you are partly fit and strong. I am almost 21 years old and run mostly everyday and on my college's cross country and track team, so the PT part of BMT will be easy. Air Force is considered to have the more easier basic military training than other branches, but you still have to be prepared for it and it totally depends on your squadron sometimes and they do yell in your face.

&#x200B;

Edit: I did the calculations, and with my current debt of around $42,000, my monthly payments to get debt free by the time I graduate the air force is $986 a month. The highest you can enlist as an Airmen is E3 (Airman First Class) and they get paid 2,042 per month, which is 24,504. But after taxes that is around 18,378 (taxes is around 25% of your income usually). i take that number divided by 12 and that is by monthly income, 1531 dollars. Paying $1000 per month is very doable and I will be able to save 500 dollars or pay for misc. stuff or extra food if need-be while at the Air Force Base. If I will wait to join the Air Force after graduating College (I do not currently plan to go in as an Officer), then my $65,000 in debt at %6 interest rate will be a monthly pay of $1,526 per month to pay it off in 4 years. Which is a lot more, and at that rate I will continue to pay on it for another year after the Air Force while I have a normal Civilian Job. I can always stay in the Air Force though if I believe it is a right fit for me. And I can talk to my parents or Grandpa to see if they can help too but I can't bet on that. Also going to copy this in the Air Force subreddit as well.

I had the privilege of touring the SpaceX facility in Hawthorne and felt really inspired by the intellect and goals of the employees I talked to at the company, and it seriously inspired me to want to pursue something in the sciences in the future. The problem is that I sort of lost my passion for learning in high school and stopped taking it seriously and paying attention, particularly in math and science.

So my question is: would it be unreasonable for me to pursue something in science or mathematics in college?

This year, I received major-specific $2,000 that I did not receive last year because my grades improved. There are only five of these scholarships up-for-grabs within my major. Because my grades improved, I was awarded the scholarship that is now allowing me to not take out any loans. 

However, my grades improved because I was enrolled in 12 credit hours last semester instead of the usual 15 that I take. Because I was enrolled in 12 credit hours instead of 15, my grades improved and I now have a loan-free year. My advisor wants me to take at least 15 credit hours every semester so that I can graduate more or less on time (I'm a double major). 

Would it be wise to keep taking 12 credit hours a semester against my advisor's advice and risk graduating later but without as much debt or should I continue to take 15 credit hours a semester and graduate more or less on time with significantly more debt than the $8,000 that I owe now?

I see a lot of kids being forced by their parents into fields they're not passionate and it concerns me. I absolutely love my major, the career prospects, and feel very lucky that I am driven with a passion for doing what I love. I don't know if it's just my school with a high acceptance rate, but I've been seeing a trend. 

It breaks my heart how many people in my classes are being forced into nursing by their parents. They  aren't given a license and opportunity to explore what they enjoy. They're expected to just attend classes and never question their parent's judgement. Or, they're forcing to double major and deal with a ridiculous amount of stress. My friend is trying to double major in music (demanding major with ten classes) and balance his parents' desire for him to go into speech pathology, and it's a lot for him to handle. 

I had to counsel a friend in my psychology class about his parents wanting him to go into nursing. His real passion was computer science or business, and I had to tell him that at the end of the day, his parents are just people with a certain opinion about what career he should go into. If he did become a nurse to please them but never followed his true passion, that wouldn't have been good for anyone. I dunno about you guys but I can't serve people well when I'm not happy. I can't be there, be present, if I don't love what I'm doing.

I realize not everyone has the ability to pursue a career they're passionate about. Sometimes familial financial stressors are real and a healthcare profession can help a lot. For a lot of people, college is a number's game to get a better life, and I wholly respect that. I'm just saying that parents don't have to be the end-all be all in deciding where a child's life will go. There's other fields and disciplines, and allowing exploration is healthy, even beneficial. Everything will go smoother if the student is studying something they actually enjoy. 

Forcing a child to pursue a career in one discipline while ignoring the profitability of others is my main concern. Especially when forcing someone into a healthcare field, this can have real consequences. Those who pursued a college education to please their parents who find themselves stuck in a career serving others that they do not enjoy does not serve anyone well. 

I also see an alarming number of students go straight into college without doing any market research. Lots of kids have ideas of going to grad school, but there are other ways to get into fields like physical therapy that are a lot more immediate and therefore provide more experience faster. Having all the information you can about a field you're going into is important, having a realistic view before commuting tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars into something that might not be a true passion is important.  

I feel like associate's degrees are underrated. I know loads of kinesiology majors wanting to go into physical therapy, and while getting a bachelor's degree can be great, getting an associate's could make more sense. I've seen physical therapy assistant salaries are pretty great, you get your hands into the field sooner, better return on investment, and if PT does end up not being the right choice, they can always get a bachelor's degree. I've seen loads of openings for this kind of position, there is market demand, and it doesn't make sense to me to major in something you've never really tried out in the real world. 

I read somewhere that the average amount of times people change their careers throughout their lifespan is five to seven times. That's a lot of career changes. Doing market research is also important to make sure that what you're majoring in will pay off. Loads of popular majors like Biology, English, Social sciences, and others have a pretty high percentage of people that regret their major decision. While there are some advantages to these fields and there's nothing wrong with absolutely loving them, having a realistic idea of what life will be like after graduation is important.

Throughout several ""draw my life"" videos I've watched, the darkest time people mention is usually when they graduate college and face the real world. In my local area there is actually a support group for such people on how much reality can bite. It's hard when you had a great time studying anthropology, but can only get a job as a dental receptionist. My friend actually had to move to another state for better cost of living.

Going to grad school doesn't have to be right after college. My mom got her master's degree in her fifties, and her world experience gave her advantages as an applicant. I feel like lots of people say they want to pursue a PhD, and that's great. However, there are some issues with oversaturated fields and limited tenured job opportunities. Things are different in today's world than they were for our professors. 

I see lots of psychology majors who intend to go to graduate school, and that's great. We always need more healthcare professionals. However, a psychology degree on its own has limited applications (my mom said the only job you could get is being a caseworker). Grad school is hard to get into, and I feel like we should be more honest about that. Having career field experience can be extremely valuable, and it should not be undermined. Doing market research is important, and it's not worth going thousands of dollars into debt to pursue a major you don't love or one that doesn't give you the standard of living you desire.

&#x200B;

I'm currently (at least in terms of timeline) a senior in college working on an Aerospace Engineering degree.  Let me provide some context for this post:

&#x200B;

I wanted to pursue a career in design and engineering, and since I loved aviation with a passion, I basically went straight to a university (the only one that accepted me) after high school, and pursued Aero Engineering.

&#x200B;

First year, wasn't the brightest. I went from going on academic warning to probation from first semester going onto second. I knew I screwed up, and I wasn't taking stuff seriously. This was an expensive school, and I had to use private loans to play a little less than 3/4 tuition since my grants and aid only covered 1/4. After the first year, I decided to step things up, and after passing two summer courses I transferred over from a local community college with straight As, I felt confident that I could recover.

&#x200B;

Second year, and I did just that. Both semesters, nearly all B's and A's. 3.0 term GPAs on each, and felt I was ready to be back on track. Again, took more summer courses to catch up, however only able to pass one class out of the two (I was taking Chem with Lab and Calc III, and I ended up passing Calc)

&#x200B;

Third year, it was okay in the first half. Took statics in the fall (technically was supposed to take that fall semester second year) and passed with a B, so I felt, again, confident going forward. Then, came a semester that the entire engineering college here knew as, ""The Gauntlet"". Basically, an entire semester filled with engineering science courses. I took 4, along with an aviation class for my technical elective. Failed 2 (Thermo and Solids), 2 were with D's (Fluid Mech and Dynamics), so I couldnt pass because of C or higher prereqs, and only passed my elective.

&#x200B;

Then, oh boy. Senior year. Retook about 3 of the previous classes, with an Electical Engineering class and lab. Passed that, but again, D's on the rest.. Now second semester comes, and i'm just here like, ugh, what is going on. Now, this semester, at least for the first half, I was under a lot of stress because I had a health scare and couldn't focus for the life of me. Now that everything migrated online after spring break, I had a chance to just fix what I could and focus harder, and now I can say that I'm doing better in those courses, though we'll have to see after finals.

&#x200B;

Point is, I just dont know how to feel it all anymore. Honestly, looking back, I feel that taking all those ES courses was a way of ""weeding"" me out of the rest. I feel like I should've just given up and did something else for a major for my own sake. But to me, I didnt want that. I came here for engineering, and I wasn't going to stop. A lot of acquaintances of mine say I was stubborn not to quit, but admitted that they admired me for that, though I can't say that really does me much. With all this debt I have already (Oh, dont worry, it's in the 6 figures already), and the fact I need another 2 years at least to finish, assuming I do, it just seems not practical to me in a sense. For those wondering, yes I did work part time for two years on campus. (I had to work more this year( about 30 hours a week) since I went off campus and was renting a room in a neighboring town.)

I'm looking for some advice from those of you who have entered and succeeded in college but had a bad GPA in highschool.

Let me give a little background about myself to help you understand my situation: I have just turned 27. I could not have cared less about school when I was in highschool. This was due to a combination of boredom and not understanding why I was forced to learn things I did not want to learn. Long story short I managed to graduate highschool with a 1.807 GPA on a scale of 4.0 (I'm pretty sure).

As soon as I graduated I entered the workforce. I've done many different types of work; Apprentice electrician, fast food cook, restaurant cook/food prep, laborer, janitor, retail clerk, customer service and even a brief stint as an insurance salesman. 

After years of working either full time or nearly full time I have learned much about life, myself and the world around me. My conclusions from what I have learned is that I need to follow my dream of becoming a novelist while earning a degree that could allow me to do freelance work or a job where I can earn an income while pursuing my dream.

I have been told countless times that I do not need a degree to pursue that dream. I understand that, however, I cannot continue to rely on a $24,000 salary as a 27 year old man with light debt still living with his parents. I want something I can fall back on while I wait for something I write to be picked up by a publisher if it ever does. I also do not want to go into the mills or refineries in Indiana to earn my living. 

What I'm looking for is advice what to do. Should I go to a community college to improve my GPA? Will I need to do an online degree course thing? I'm at a loss and would love for someone to help me figure out my path. 

Thanks for hearing me out. Ill respond to anyone who seeks further clarification or offers advice. Thank you!",1577057520.0

I was anticipating my father helping me out with this, as he was in the past setting aside a little of each of his paychecks. Unfortunately, early this year he found himself in some debt and had to use up that money. Then, this last month he passed away, and I don't have any money to inherit.

I‚Äôm a high school senior going to university this fall. I work a part time job currently to save up for school but I haven‚Äôt even started saving with all these senior costs adding up. I take dual credit classes and textbooks are really expensive, AP exam fees, graduation fees, freshman orientation fees, gas, etc. I  work <20 hrs per week because I have schoolwork to focus on and the money I make is almost always spent right away. (I rarely eat out btw)

I qualified for a Pell Grant and got some institutional aid from my school which totals to ~9,945 which leaves ~$4000 per year of tuition excluding  books, parking passes, etc

This is still going to be a burden for my family and I to pay. I plan on working more hours especially during breaks and the summer. Last thing I want is my part time job (maybe full time later on) to start messing up the amount of money from fafsa I get. I know that student income is held higher than parents/family income.

So my question is: is there like a cutoff or something where fafsa will start decreasing your aid?

Also on a side note,
- my job sucks and and the pay is shit for the work I do but I‚Äôm putting up with it because I need the money. I‚Äôm planning to be pre-med or pre-PA and I want to get certified in something (like pharmacy tech medical assistant, emt ) but the costs of getting certified are insane!

Along with that, I only applied to a couple schools with pretty good Computer Science/Game Design programs. As of now, I am accepted and planning to attend one of these colleges.

University of Wisconsin (accepted): The college is out-of-state, but I qualify for reciprocity so I would be paying in-state tuition. After all is said and done, my net cost of attendance is about $10,450 (after deducting $6,450 in federal grants and a $3,000 merit-based scholarship). My second year would cost roughly the same, but during my 3rd and 4th years, I would not have the merit-based scholarship. Overall, my total student debt for attending this college would be around $50,000, which is quite high in my opinion, but this is the only school I could attend without taking a gap year.

University of Minnesota: I recently found out that a college in the University system offers a $6,000 scholarship renewable for 4 years to valedictorians and superlatorians (I am the superlatorian of my class as of now), but in order to receive this I would have to enroll as a first year student (meaning I haven't completed any college coursework after graduating high school). The overall CoA of UMD is about $26,000 before any deductions. I would for sure qualify for the $6,000 merit-based scholarship, but aside from that, everything becomes iffy. This year, I qualified for $6,450 in federal grants and $6,000 in state grants (which I can't use if I go to UW since it's out of state). I'd assume that during my possible gap year, I wouldn't make any more than $20k. If I were to receive the same amount in federal and state grants next year as I did this year, my net CoA for this university would be less than $10k per year; their cost of attendance calculator actually estimates it would be as low as $3,500.

The only thing I'm highly unsure of is how my income during my gap year would affect my financial aid eligibility.

I guess my question is this: Should I take a gap year and apply to UMD which has a potential overall CoA of $14k? Or should I suck it up and go to UW for $50k with no gap year?

If I should take a gap year, what are some things I could do to keep my skills sharp in regards to a Computer Science major? Is there anything that would be a full use (aka show off many different skills)? Is there any type of project that would bolster my future applications/portfolio? These can even be things like learning math, writing, etc. Pretty much anything that can help me gain either experience or a competitive advantage.

Important things to note: 
- My parents likely would not affect my FAFSA next year. 
- From what I have heard, both schools have pretty good computer science programs, though I believe UMD may have some kind of research facility. 
- Many people I know from elementary, middle, and high school plan to go to UMD. 
- The closest city (about 30 miles away) has a population of 194,000, but I'm not sure if there would be many internship opportunities for non-college students with little experience.",1588038916.0

The problem is that this school, being about 5 hours away, is on the pricier side (to me at least) at about 17-20K in total cost of attendance. I initially enrolled at the school as a computer science major and I had a $3000 comp sci scholarship that went with it. With my other scholarships and a federal work study position on campus, I was still a little short but I was able to cover the remaining $5500 in loans through the school. Come winter break, I realized that computer science was not for me, so I switched my major to Business Administration Comprehensive, Management Information Systems Emphasis. My grades improved and I'm liking my courses so far.

This year will be even more financially difficult if I choose to keep studying here. I'm being offered about $8000 in financial aid including work study. $6500 is being offered in loans through the school. That means I'll have to cover the remaining 3-5k on my own. I'm working 35-40 hours a week at $9.50 an hour. It'll net me about $4000 this summer by the time school starts. However, I'll be 12k in debt at the end of sophomore year. If I keep going to school there, I would live off campus Junior and Senior year (I have to live in the fraternity house on campus sophomore year). I really really don't wanna end up 20K+ in debt by graduation. There is an alternative though. 

There is a college here in my hometown (where I'm currently living with my parents) that offers essentially the same degree. Business Admin., Option in Business Information Systems. I've already checked to see if my classes will transfer. All of them will except one. Total cost of attendance here is about 6-7K. I'm already being offered $4200 in financial aid and I can easily cover the remaining costs with my job without having to take ANY loans whatsoever.

Logically the answer is clear. If I wanna stay debt free, I gotta transfer to hometown college. I wouldn't live with my parents, so I would rent myself a place here in town with hopefully a roommate or two. Only being $5500 in debt right now, I could easily start making payments on it and probably finish paying it off by the time I graduate. Graduating debt free will put me so much farther ahead than a lot of people I know.

 I'm having such a hard time making a decision about this because the last thing I wanna do is leave behind my boyfriend and a lot of my best friends. Yeah we would keep in touch and yeah I could drive down there occasionally in the old car my parents are letting me use (mine broke down at the end of the school year), but it wouldn't be the same. I'd have to leave behind marching band and my fraternity to go to a smaller college in the small town I grew up in... Do I go further in debt to keep going to my school of choice, or do I do what's financially best for me and transfer to the cheaper school? My parents obviously are on the side of me transferring here but I need some decent unbiased feedback and perspective before I make a decision. Any help is greatly appreciated!

TL:DR Just finished an amazing year 1 at University in which my SO, best friends, marching band, and fraternity is. I only enrolled there in the first place to study computer science, which I have switched to a better major. To continue going to school there would bring me further down in debt. If I transfer to the college in my hometown, which offers the same major, I can potentially graduate debt free. Do I take on the debt to continue going to school? Or do I transfer to hometown college and graduate with 0 debt? I'm extremely torn and could use some help.",1560403839.0

Student loans are a relatively risk free loan, in the sense that you cannot default on them, it takes 30 years of living in destitution for them to be forgiven, and your death bequeaths these debts onto your children. However, *student loans are not offered at prime lending rate*. That is to say, many loans that are considered a *greater financial risk* to the lender are offered at prime lending or close to it, while our perma-loans are nearly twice as expensive or more. The conclusion is clear: our generation has failed to collectively bargain in the fashion that the ruling class of our society continues to, especially now.


We stand at a precipice. Unemployment and social unrest are rapidly increasing as our federal government continues to prioritize economic gains at the expense of the health of our people. Trillions of dollars were fed into a thinly veiled pump and dump of our stock market, meanwhile most students in this country will see no financial aid from the government. Those who graduated before and have entered the workplace fare no better. As workers are furloughed in increasing numbers, rent payments have not ceased. Student loan debt continues to accrue interest.


Complaints against this odious system are gaining a critical mass. We are frustrated by a world where we find financial ruin by quarantining, or find that same ruin by seeking medical help with an almost unpayable price. Most Americans support Medicaid for all, and yet this is argued upon podiums as if a contentious or unfeasible issue. Even notable celebrities are starting to comment on the systems of wealth inequality that punish us all - Brittney Spears and Fran Drescher caught my eye just today.


If rich socialites can speak freely on the internet regarding fiscal disobedience, so can we. Now is a crucial moment when people are paying attention to their screens, having nothing better to do. now is a crucial moment when the government is ill-equipped to reign in a collective political force motivated by dissatisfaction at the status quo.

- the reason he keeps saying money isn‚Äôt/won‚Äôt be an issue is because he supposedly is getting this 97k paying job but knowing how he is, he will either quit it or end up just wasting a bunch of that money on fruitless ambitions
- we went on a tour to university B and some guy who was on the tour with us told him not to let me go there (didn‚Äôt tell me why he said that though??)
- speaking of the tour he barely paid attention to any of it, complained about every building we went into, wanted us to go home early, and was just acting like a complete child 
- I explained to him that the tour guide literally showed us multiple safety features that are on the campus but he for some reason believes that they only said that to persuade people to come there and that the features aren‚Äôt actually good (which may be true but still..)
- and I‚Äôve explained to him that university B has my degree but that doesn‚Äôt matter to him I guess?
- he also told me ‚Äúlet the smaller fish go to catch the bigger fish‚Äù in regards to my scholarship üòê

I feel like he just sees me as an ignorant & naive 17 year old girl and won‚Äôt listen to me or my side. He keeps saying that ‚Äúlater I will thank him and mom for making the best possible decision for me‚Äù.

I continually hear about how students who take remedial classes have a significantly harder time graduating not just on time but in general. I'm an out-of-state student with a four year scholarship that will help me out if I graduate within four years.

But if I take remedial classes then my scholarship dries out along with my financial aid. My family will be in debt. I'll be in debt. And I'll have wasted everyone's time including mine. Without a degree to show for it.

138,138,What Should You Major In? A Short Guide to Figuring it Out,31,ffrixn,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/ffrixn/what_should_you_major_in_a_short_guide_to/,2,"Hey everyone. I've seen a lot of the same question here over the past year or so that I've been browsing. Something along the lines of, ""What should I major in?"", ""Which of these majors should I pick?"". Lots of helpful people have commented and attempted to give the best advice they can. While each person's situation is unique, I figured that I would try to compile the most common responses and add in some of my own advice. 

**Should I Even Go to College?**

Before we can start to talk about majors I want to briefly touch on an even more important question that people often skip over. More and more people seem to feel like they have to go to college. How else can you get a well-paying job? While it's true that people with a bachelor's degree do earn more than those without, but college isn't for everyone. There are other options. Trade schools can never have enough students, and despite what you may read on the internet you can work your way up at certain businesses, especially sales if you play your cards right. What's worse than not going to college? Going to college and realizing halfway through that it wasn't for you and starting from square one again but with $20,000 in debt. No one decision is right for everyone and its very important that if you do decide to go to college you do so knowing that its the right choice for you. 

**What Should I Major In?**

A big concern for most students is getting a job after college. Will the expense of the degree pay off? Most people immediately jump to job statistics or browsing their target university's degree catalog. While this approach can work out for some, I've found that most of the time it can be very hard to figure out if the career is actually a good fit. 

Instead, try to think about what your ideal career looks like. Obviously this isn't easy, especially if you're 18 and don't have any previous work experience. If this sounds like you, try to think about the following questions. It's ok if thinking through this takes a good amount of time. Deciding on a career is one of the most important things in your life. It makes sense for it to take longer than an hour or two. 

Do you like having a set routine and schedule?

Do you not mind having to do similar things on a day to day basis?

Do you like interacting with other people? If so, do you like interacting with Coworkers? Other professionals? People you don't know very well? 

You wouldn't believe how many of my friends have gone into engineering only to discover in their summer internships that most engineering jobs are glorified office jobs. Where you sit around and work on similar things every day. I'm not saying that all engineering jobs are like this, but not everything is research or testing. 

After you've thought about some of these things you can start to see if the careers you have in mind fit your criteria. Career aptitude tests and other online resources can be very helpful for this. Don't be afraid to reach out to local professionals or professors either. Most people are flattered that someone is interested in what they do for a living and are more than happy to take a few minutes to respond to an email. The worst thing that could happen is that they simply don't respond and you move on. 

My personal recommendation is the O*NET Interest Profiler.
https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip

Once you've found the careers you're interested in, go on job sites like Indeed and find out **what degrees will help you get that job**. Remember, it's not about the degree, it's about the job, and how you get there.

**What Degrees Are Actually Viable?**

Now that you have an idea of what career you would actually like, you're probably asking yourself if what you've picked is really feasible. If you've done any amount of online research I'm sure you've found an overwhelming flood of articles and posts proclaiming that anything outside of STEM or Business will land you in heaps of debt and make you miserable. The truth of the matter, along with most things, is that its complicated. 

In my opinion, the most important thing is that you pursue something that you're passionate about. Now before the engineers chase me out of town with pitchforks, I don't mean that you should drop everything to take out $100,000 in loans for art school. I mean that you absolutely should not go to school for something you don't have some sort of passion for. 

It's a myth that if you do what you love you'll never work a day in your life. Even something you love is going to be tough some times, but if you love something, it makes the hard times easier to get through, which consequently you'll be more likely to go the extra mile. 

A good general rule of thumb is to only plan to take out as much in loans as you can reasonably expect to earn in your first year on the job. Just remember, less is always better. $5000 may not seem like much now compared to tens of thousands but when you consider years of interest every dollar adds up. That's a subject for a different thread though. 

For the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a great resource. It allows you to see salaries for a given field as well as things like total number of jobs and projected job growth.
https://www.bls.gov/
 
Keeping this in mind, you can weigh your options and make smarter decisions about your future. 

**Final Thoughts**

College is an important time of your life, but you should be excited! Do your research and think carefully about your options and you're sure to come out on top. Never be afraid to ask questions and seek out advice from professionals. And lastly, always be open to change. It's ok to change your mind. Most people end up changing majors at least once or twice in college, but if you think things over carefully each change you make will take you so much closer to where you want to be.

Supposedly remainder for TAP and PELL Grants.",2,fqxyjo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/fqxyjo/3818_check_from_college_financial_aid_office_is/,2,"In August of 2019 I filed for TAP and PELL for college here in NYS and was qualified for maximum benefits. TAP was a little late, and in order to pay for tuition, I had to take Stafford loans out and was told that the school would pay the Stafford loans for me when TAP came in (PELL came significantly earlier than TAP). I spent a month and a half in college before dropping out because of the stress (I had requested my Highschool Accommodations as I was told I could do and never received them and it became too stressful to stay).

&#x200B;

In January I received a check from the college for $3.8k for what was labeled simply as ""Refund-Payment."" I took the check to the financial aid office, and was told that it was the remainder of the financial aid from the TAP and PELL, and that it was my money. After further pressuring the rep at the office (she didn't want to go through the trouble of looking at my account and was basically convinced it was 'my' money) she discovered that I had $2.7k for Stafford loans due. She said that I could return the check to them, and they'll subtract the total loan amount and send me the remaining $1.1k. A few days later I received mail from Direct Loans stating that I had given my permission from the school to distribute the money to them and if they didn't receive any email from me stating otherwise over the next 3 business days it'll proceed as follows. Obviously I left it, thinking that I was going to walk debt free and get the remaining $1.1k from TAP and PELL later.   


Fast forward until now and I haven't heard anything more from Direct Loans (the lender I'm assuming) and I haven't received any calls or emails from the school regarding anything related to any checks, loans or federal grants. Then, today (March 28th) I received another check for $3.8k dated March 24th (so it's a new check).

&#x200B;

I'm not entirely sure what to do here. I don't know if I still have pending loans. I'm unsure if I should cash this check and pay off other things (I had to take a personal loan for a laptop required for the class at an unrelated bank), or cash it and leave it for now, or just keep a hold of it for now.",1585477216.0

I'm at a point where I feel like the past three and a half years have all gone to waste. I started off wanting to go to college for music. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with that exactly but I knew I wanted to do music. I decided to go for an English major with a minor in secondary education instead when my dad got upset with me for wanting to do music in college, saying it would be a waste of money on a major that has very little job opportunities. I did well in those classes but only because they were easy for me but honestly, I hated it and found that I enjoyed the finite math class I had taken to complete my GEDs.

Well, I changed to a math major with a minor in computer science. Turns out, I only enjoy the part of math that actually has numbers in it, not the part where I have to come up with profs to things that I don't even understand. Ever since I switched majors, my grades have been extremely poor, I failed one class and have gotten D's and C's in the rest. My computer science classes are doing fine. It's only things like number theory and survey of geometry and discrete math that I've been doing poorly in. I genuinely hate my major. I'm struggling. I feel unmotivated, I feel completely lost. I'm at a point where I feel like I should just continue for the sake of finishing college. I'm not even graduating with my class because the change in majors set me back a semester, possibly longer since I failed a class that isn't offered every semester.

I chose the program because it was accredited and they offered me a discount because of my affiliation with the military. Long story short, I am going to be graduating with less than $6k in debt, which is pretty good for a BA. 
I have family that attended University of Phoenix for their Nurse Practitioner programs and they recommended it because the pass rate for the state exams were so high.

I majored in English which does not require any kind of exam that would allow me to distance myself from the school and the negative stigma that surrounds it. This is not something that I had previously considered when I applied to the program. 

I recognize that finding a career as an English major is difficult enough as it is and I am concerned that my decision to attend University of Phoenix will ultimately hold me back from potential employment. Now the VA has announced that they plan to cut GI bill funding for University of Phoenix. This doesn't impact me financially but it does put the institution back in the news. Every time I see the school in the media I cringe because I'm worried it's going to impact the way people view my degree.

I have been thinking about using grad school as a way to distance myself from the institution (while it's still accredited). I was really looking forward to having such little debt to pay off and attending a grad program is obviously going to increase my debt dramatically, so I am hesitant.

I have currently taken 32 credit hours and have a 3.07 :/ (first semester I got a 2.78 because I didn't really care). I have 41 credit hours at my community college remaining. To get a collateral major I will need to take 54 credit hours at the University. 

(School costs)

As stated before my first two years are free as I go to a community college in Tennessee. I will take about 72 hours free. I will have to take 54 credit hours at the University. 

So the cost of attendance before scholarships and book costs should be $‚Ä≠23,826 for my 54 credit hours‚Ä¨.

The university has a transfer scholarship if you have a 3.5-3.75 they will give you $3,000 a year or if you have a 3.25-3.49 you get $1,000 annually. (One question I have is should I sacrifice some hours at work so I can improve grades to hopefully get 3.5 and above, I would need about an A in all the classes. Or should I take more hours and save that pay and sacrifice some of my GPA.)

I also get $2,250 annually if I stay above a 2.75.

I'm going to try and get a job at UPS before I transfer to the University because they have a $5,520 tuition reimbursement annually. (I'm going to try at the end of this upcoming fall semester and maybe even call them when I'm hoping to apply and make a good impression)

So if everything goes right it would leave me with about $1,413 annually (before book costs) from just scholarships and tuition reimbursement.

I also don't qualify for any grants (My parents are divorced and I lived with my mom for the most part and she makes about $50,000)

(Job and Normal Costs)

I currently work at Lowe's and make $11.31 hourly I'm currently working 35-40 hours a week, but I'm hoping to transfer to a closer store to get fewer hours during the school year (still over 3 months away), but it might take a little away from my pay. I have about $1,200 in savings and my next paycheck (next Thursday) should be $700-750.

I live with my sister and pay $200 in rent. My mom and dad both separately pay $200 (I'm very thankful), but I would not be surprised if my dad stops paying $200; because he doesn't really need to, but he is just helping me and my sister out.

The main expense I need help with is food. I'm 18 years old and 6'3-6'4 and hungry most of the day. I can spend upwards of like $400 on food monthly (just from making dumb food choices: eating a lot of fast food as the only meal of the day.) I've started to just eat a Clif bar and maybe a bag of chips to be able to save more money but sacrificing nutrients.

I am also actively looking for another job over the summer so I can save more money.

155,155,Can the benefits of a top tier school ever outweigh a 280k debt?,24,8tq909,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8tq909/can_the_benefits_of_a_top_tier_school_ever/,65,"Hello, to set some facts straight: I am 18; graduating high school this month; I will be solely responsible for college debt; I 100&#37; want to go to into business, but whether I am absolutely set on doing only finance I am not one hundred percent sure; I receive no financial aid but still come from a position where I have to shoulder the debt so that my parents can retire any time soon.

At the moment, as late as it is in the college admissions process, I am still deciding between two schools. One school is Vanderbilt, where I would major economics-- this school is in the South, has an amazing campus, great professors, and the happiest students (really anything that you can ask for from a top a school). As many people have made the mistake of doing, I have fallen in love with this school.  The problem is that my debt would be 280k.

**Why am I not crazy for considering this option?** Taking out a public loan at 6&#37; rate would mean I have monthly payments of 2000 which I can definitely meet with a job, then I can refinance (not sure what the correct term is) the loan and pay it a 2.7&#37; rate with a private company (SOFI), paying around 20k total a year in loans and 500k overall (loan+interest).

Some other factors that I am thinking about are: I am only 18-22 once, as someone who is really into business I understand that big risks CAN payoff greatly, I want to be surrounded by people smarter and better than me,  and of course, the big, ego-stroking factor of prestige. I have heard the argument thousands of times, but I still cannot deny that prestige sells.

My other option, is a business/engineering school which will end up costing me around 70k (total). This school is top 400 in the nation, private, and at this school I would be right across from Wall Street and focused on finance. Somethings about this school: it is only 40 minutes away (which I hate), it is 30/70 girls/boys (which you might find stupid but the ratios are important to me), an okay campus, and the professors are completely average. That being said, it is still a good school which provides really good opportunities for people looking to work directly in finance.

If you have read this far, thank you. I would love to hear some input from you guys and would truly appreciate any advice whatsoever on my decision.

THANK YOU

For the first year I did end up having financial aid and ended up help pay most of the tuition. However, after the first year there was a problem related to my family, so I ended up not getting financial aid for the next 2 years. I ended up paying 25k a year with private loans. I was very skeptical after the first year as to whether or not I should continue because of the amount of loans I'd have to use. I decided that I didnt want to pursue it because of the money, but my friends and family pressured me into it saying that it's a worth while investment to go to college. However, I went to an art school. I went in knowing fully that the piece of paper I'd be receiving is useless. I mostly went for the experience of learning and networking, because in the end that's all that really matters in an art school to my knowledge. However, due to the amount of loans, I dont feel like I'm getting my money's worth for that price?

Our retention rate is less than 30% for a number of factors (mostly because a lot of people are ex-military). I came to this college because I didn't want to go to a state school in the middle of nowhere and my parents wouldn't allow me to even think about going to college abroad. For the first two years I lived with drug dealers, wannabe rappers, and overall very mean spirited people. I constantly talked with my friends who got into NYU and UCLA, how they felt so happy and that they were making friends from around the world..meanwhile my university has a policy that says you can't room a domestic and international student together.

I looked into getting out of the US to a university in Czech Republic my first year, but depression and a lack of family support basically stopped me in my tracks. One minute they'd tell me ""If its cheaper, go for it"" the next they'd tell me their concerns about job prospects and how ""American schools are the best in the world"". as if I got into Georgetown.

I had the chance to change majors to computer science, but at the time I still felt as though my program would prepare me somewhat for the job market. Turns out, I should've switched programs. On the basis of being ""nonpartisan"" at a university level, supposedly my program isnt actually allowed to do their job to help us network in our field.. meanwhile the Computer Science students have Amazon and Google representatives basically every semester helping them find work.

I'm graduating with about 40k in student loan debt, and I'm dreading the idea of going back to get a Masters. When I do, its going to be in a STEM subject (likely Data Science or Computer Science), and abroad. I don't give a fuck what my parents say, I'm not going into more debt. I feel guilty for putting them through this and not dropping out, because ultimately it was my choice to continue on through this program. I just didn't know how bad it was until senior year, I guess. Right now with borders shutting down and joblessness becoming a huge thing, going home from DC to South Carolina would kill my career.

If I had the option I guess I'd brush up on my Mandarin and get a computer Science Masters in China or Estonia, even though my heart is telling me to get a Masters in East Asian studies... but fuck it, I'll go for what pays the bills at this point. I'm scared of the next few months, but I think the regret of the last four years basically trumps any fear of the next few months. To know I wasted so much time and money for a degree in a program that refuses to help students, in an environment where I wasn't able to have even a remotely positive college experience.. It just hurts.

Right now i'm looking at teaching English online to make some money and keep myself afloat for a year, then I might go abroad to teach English, or Peace Corps, or maybe yeah go for a Masters in Data or Computer Science abroad. God knows I'm not going another 40k into debt..

TL;DR: Graduating with a social science from a notoriously hard program, very little contact from administration much less job advice from professors, regret not going abroad for a Bachelors, regret not changing my major when I had the option.

I've (20F) been living with my toxic, emotionally abusive parents to offset the debt of university. I am a full-time commuter student, and I work anywhere from 25 to 28 hours a week. I've been paying off my student loans slowly since I started college. I started out with \~10k in federal loans, and I'm now down to \~5k. I was supposed to graduate in 2021, but I transferred after my freshman year and now won't be graduating until 2022 if I follow my current academic plan.

My mental health has been poor my entire life. As soon as I entered college, I sought treatment for my mental health. I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and atypical anorexia during my freshman year of college. However, I've never had a consistent therapist. My parents do not believe in mental health and obviously do not want me to seek professional help. According to them, I should simply get over all of the trauma that they put me through.

This past semester has been one of the most difficult semesters I've had since my freshman year. I have relapsed both with my eating disorder and a history of self-harm. I was going to kill myself last month (after years of various unsuccessful suicide attempts) until a friend of mine stepped in, and I will be staying with her out-of-state over the summer while working a paid internship (the internship is the only reason why my parents agreed to the whole thing).

After the summer is up, I can either return to living with my parents while I finish my degrees as planned, or I can finish my degree online either at my current university or by transferring to a university closer to where my friend lives. If I were to finish my degrees online, however, I run the risk of not being able to afford to do so (my federal aid runs out after six years; I'll need five total years to graduate just by living with my parents), and I run the risk of taking six or seven years to graduate with a bachelor's degree.

I am totally at a lost here. I'd love to continue my studies online, work an actual job full-time, and get out from under my parents and finally be my own, independent person. But everyone keeps saying that I should just stick it out for two more years and then run.",1583575164.0

My sisters and I are about 2-3 years apart from each other so I want to minimize the amount of money my parents will eventually spend on school. 


My finances: 
I have a job but my monthly earnings come out to $100-$120.  I‚Äôve taken up paying for all of my college applications but it has put a significant dent in my savings account. I also started paying my share of the cell phone bill and car insurance because my parents needed the help. When my sisters need to buy something unanticipated or when we haven‚Äôt done groceries in a few weeks I‚Äôll pay for their food since I know they are hungry. 
Money I have: $125
Yes I have been applying to niche $1-3K scholarships but no news so far. 


College: 
I‚Äôve been accepted into 2 of my safety schools so far
- Saint Mary‚Äôs of CA | $25K/yr scholarship | tuition $47K
- Concordia Irvine | $19K scholarship | tuition $33K

Will be applying to UH Manoa (#1 choice) as a WUE student which cuts OOS tuition to ~$16K



EFC = 049360 

Even if my parents aren‚Äôt helping me with college, I‚Äôm still their dependent until 24. However, if I get married, I would be eligible for more financial aid because my spouse and I make under $30K. 

What do you think? 
Am I A). Being a naive teenager thinking I found a loophole or B). Actually cheating the system by marrying early



TL;DR: parents are in debt and my EFC is high. will getting married help or harm my ability to receive more financial aid?",1580808983.0

Today was the affiliated school‚Äôs first week of classes so everyone is buying/renting/picking up books. 

We always have a deadline for returns (which is always by which point you won‚Äôt need or probably want your books) if you don‚Äôt return the books, a card on file will be repeatedly charged. It won‚Äôt just be the book‚Äôs price. It will also appear on your account and you will keep getting fees.

The other day I was ringing out a student. They mentioned wanting to rent, I asked for their account phone number. When I punched it into the system an error message occurred that said something to the effect of ‚Äúaccount is suspended cannot rent‚Äù so I grabbed my manager and he checks out the guys account. 

He comes back and says the guy can literally not rent anything and he also has upstanding fees on a TON of books dating back to 2018. So for TWO years this guy hasn‚Äôt returned his books. That generates fees. Fees he has to pay off. When rentals aren‚Äôt returned, the store suffers and we lose money but it‚Äôs on record that the individual has to pay the fees and the later they wait the more it grows. My manager says if the wrong people in the company see this guys account it won‚Äôt be good for him because he owes A LOT of money. I don‚Äôt recall if law suits came up but the guy has placed himself in a deep hole of debt. Additionally if he hadn‚Äôt gotten the account suspended he would‚Äôve only paid 100ish for what he purchased. He had to spend 400$ because he couldn‚Äôt rent. 

Guys, I know you might not even use the books they say you have to or maybe you‚Äôre lazy,  trust me I am too I get it.  Just bring your rentals back. College is already expensive enough. Also don‚Äôt make your parents demand to accept late books for you, take responsibility for your actions.",1580029347.0

Yeah, I know, it sucks, and I can't do anything until I move out which isn't until I graduate.

Anyways, I wanna go to a concert for the first time (my parents also think that concerts are satanic, if they find out I went I am dead). Doors open at 7, first performer from 8-9 and the artist I'm going to the concert for isn't up until 9pm. So I likely won't get out until 10:30ish and will be home at 11pm.

My parents let me stay at college until 10pm once to study in the library, but I'm not allowed to stay longer than that. Apparently I'm supposed to be grateful they even let me stay there for that long. What's a good excuse I can use for why I have to stay in college until 10:30pm (and be home by 11)? I was thinking of telling them I'm having a tutor revise my essay and that that was the only time we could meet up, but I'm worried they might not care anyway and tell me I can't stay out that long. 

Also, it needs to be something where i would have a good reason for not answering my phone. I can't have them calling me while I'm at the concert, since they will obviously hear the background and know I'm not at college. 

Please help!!

Edit: I do live in the US but it's not as simple as talking to them, trust me. My older brother has tried countless times to convince my dad to extend my curfew (my dad is mostly the issue, my mom not as much), and instead of hearing him out my dad tells my brother he's not man enough for accepting that his sister should be out late.

I can't tell them to fuck off and that I'm an adult. My dad will beat me if I go against his will, or refuse to be home by my curfew. And no he doesn't beat me on a regular basis or anything, only in situations like this where I bring ""shame"" to the family. This is the same reason why I'm still wearing a hijab/veil, even though I hate it and really want to take it off. One of my dad's friends beat up his daughter so bad she went to the hospital, all because she went on an overnight field trip despite his wishes (she was 18). She ended up moving out and living with her sister, but I don't have anyone that can support me like that: I seriously do not want to move out because having to work full time while in college is gonna make my life so much harder, and plus I won't be able to see my younger siblings anymore because if I, as a female, move out I'll basically be disowned. I'd rather suck up the unfairness for a few more years until I move out for postgraduate school and have the means to finally be independent.

I was born and raised in the U.S, and therefore am a U.S citizen, though my parents are Mexican. When we moved back to Mexico a couple years ago, my father found a job as a professor at ""Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey"" and I've already been accepted with a 90% scholarship, so I'm fortunate enough to have a fallback option in case everything goes wrong. Though ""Tec"" is a great university, they do not have the major I've been passionate about since I was in middle school: computer science, so I applied to a couple colleges in the U.S and was admitted at Penn State, albeit with no scholarship and I'll be charged out-of-state tuition. I applied for the FAFSA and have been given 11,000$ in aid for attendance. However, I still must pay 35,000$ somehow. Since my parents do not have that kind of money, my only option is taking out student loans. This is where the complication arises. I have no problem whatsoever with getting into debt because I'm sure I'll be able to pay it back. Added to that, I'll be working part time and will most likely land internships starting my first year since I already know how to code, so after the first year the economic burden will lessen. Yesterday I tried applying for students loans through Wells Fargo's online site. I played with the parameters and these are my findings:

1. I cannot take out student loans because I am still under 18 years of age (17)
2. My father cannot take out the student loans for me because he and I both are living in Mexico rn.
3. The only eligible person in my family is my sister whom is graduating from a UC school this semester and will be moving on to Cornell grad studies in August. But I highly doubt she would help me because we've always had a toxic relationship.

So what do I do? Do I have any other options? I'm really dead set on studying at computer science at Penn state and I feel so lost and hopeless. Any advice helps, thank you!",1584670259.0

and finally, i think my parents want me to major in something like biology because they care about how i look to other people. this is actually the reason i‚Äôm writing this post- we were talking to a neighbor and i told them my situation, and once i went back inside my mom blew up in my face telling me i‚Äôm wasting my time majoring in psych and that i‚Äôll be working a dead-end job i don‚Äôt like. i had to explain to her that i‚Äôm still PA and like i said before, she doesn‚Äôt understand what the fuck i mean when i tell her i can major in just about anything and still go to PA school. also my neighbor was asking me questions about school and my dad started answering questions for me. it makes me so mad because i can tell they have some plan for me that they don‚Äôt want. i‚Äôve ranted to my advisor about this more than once and she tells me every time to do what i want. what do i do in this situation? also how do i deal with my parents?

edit: 1) i am aware that what i said about debt is stupid and that i do not want more debt than less debt. 2) i am aware that a psychology BA is one of the most useless degrees i can get, which is why if i go through with psych i would go to grad school.",1562315349.0

I am currently in my first year (second semester) of college and I live with my parents. This year I received enough financial aid (grants/scholarships not loans) to cover my full tuition which was around 13k, I did not have to accept any loans due to living with my parents but keep in mind that I filed on fafsa as living with my parents. This upcoming year my cost of attendance is estimated at 27k, I filed my fafsa forms listed as ""off-campus"" instead of ""living with parents"" and received grants/scholarships at around 16k, which will cover my tuition. Housing is estimated at 10k and I also received 10k in loans I could accept. So my question is, if I filed under living with my parents would I receive less grants? I am trying to figure out my best option. In my point of view, it could potentially be cheaper if I lived off-campus if I got a full time job in the summer and saved up money for housing so I could accept all of my grants for tuition and only have to accept little to no loans for housing. I just want as little student debt as possible but I also want to move closer to campus because I definitely feel living at home and an hour away from campus is somewhat hindering my involvement to school. I am a first gen college student and would love any input from more experienced or knowledgeable students/graduates. If you have any questions in order to help answer mine please feel free to ask.

I'm a 3rd year (out of 5) undergrad in biology. I began college majoring in Vocal Performance in the College of Music. I had never considered my future in terms of providing for myself or any type of financial or job security until my first semester of college and the harsh reality of it all led me to decide that I needed to explore other avenues. 

I took a semester to examine other fields of study and eventually decided on biology. My school has two different paths to take with biology, one being Molecular and Cellular, the other being Integrative, or organismal biology. Although I much prefer the MCB topics, I chose the IB route as MCB has a very strict path to follow in terms of sequence of classes and I saw pretty quickly that it would take me many years to complete the degree in that sequence with the extra foundational work I needed to get myself up to speed (I prepared myself in high school to continue with music and therefore very much lacked the math and science background I needed to begin biology) with other biology students. 

Anyway, I'm almost two years into my new major and I feel stuck and desperate. I love biology, with my whole heart. Music really was (and is) my dream but biology is my passion. I've thoroughly enjoyed most of the bio heavy classes I've taken and I know I chose the right major, but I'm not getting the grades I want nor the grades I think I deserve. 

Like most other college freshmen, I didn't know how to study. I graduated high school with a 3.85, having worked, what I thought at the time, was pretty hard. Looking back, however, I never studied but a few handful of times. Even still, I did very well. That level of work today would be earning me Fs though so I had to figure out how to be successful in college-level courses. I think I have done a pretty decent job and I've determined that on the metric of how well I feel I understand the content. I thoroughly enjoy reading my textbooks and diving deep into content, even supplemental content to help me better understand concepts at large and how they interact with each other rather than the general overview that is mostly presented in classes. By the time I am finished studying a concept, I can coherently explain pathways and mechanisms in great detail and I do so enthusiastically. When I practice, I turn to worksheets from class and sometimes problems from the text book. When studying for exams I turn to practice exams if offered and other material from class if they are not. Although I love biology and I want to learn more than just strictly the scope of the classes I'm taking, my time is very limited and grades are important so I try not to spend too much time on content beyond my classes and when practicing I focus on exercises given to me by instructors to limit any diversion away from course goals. 

Even still, I have a 3.1 GPA. I wanted to go to med school. My hardest classes are still yet to come (calc, physics 1&2, 3 chem classes including orgo) and I have no background that will support me in these classes. I have been trying to practice and prepare my math skills as that is mostly where I falter, but I haven't been successful and I'm running out of time. I've taken precalc, finished with a C. I took a prepatory chem class, had a 90% in the class and a 91% exam average, then bombed the final despite studying and really understanding the content, ending with an 85%. I attempted physics last fall and after two panic attacks in the first couple weeks stemming from not being able to wrap my head around the concepts, I had to drop the class

I put everything I have into my classes, I really do, but, somehow, I can't prove it. I have ADD and bad anxiety and for these reasons I am registered with my school's disability resource department and I get testing accommodations through them. Without my accommodation I would be doing much, much worse and I can be thankful for that. I go to therapy regularly as well and I am putting in the work to better myself and become the person I want to be. Still, sometimes I have to use the portion of my accommodation that I have for anxiety because I am too anxious to leave the house or my panic surrounding an exam is so great that I cannot take it that day. Typically this is no issue and my professors are supposed to excuse me from attendance and other assignments for that day, as well as give me the opportunity to take the exam the following day, but I had a professor this last semester that absolutely would not give me that chance and due to loop hole in her course policies and syllabus, she didn't have to. I ended with a C in that class.   

I've had to start considering other options after college because I know my chances of getting into a medical school are pretty slim and quite honestly I don't think I have the room in my schedule anymore to take the supplemental classes I need  (biochem, a 2nd semester of orgo, psych, sociology) in addition to my major. 

I've been considering research, PA/NP school, and nursing school. 

PA/NP school seems unlikely being that they also require a higher GPA and supplemental classes, but mostly,  I don't think my heart is going to be in it. I've watched some YouTube videos about PA/NP school and done a little bit of looking around online and it seems that a big thing in PA/NP interview is the \*why\* you want to be a PA/NP and not a MD. Although I could maybe bullshit this, I know my heart won't be into it as much as it would be in an MD and knowing myself, it will show. 

Nursing seems like a good option but I fear that I will always feel, or at least will have to dedicate a good portion of my life to overcoming, the sense that I am living in the shadow of doctors; Why couldn't I have tried just a little harder and gotten the MD? No disrespect to other nurses, they are incredibly important, but ever since I changed my path, I dreamed of myself in other shoes. Additionally, I have really bad feet and seeing how nurses run around for hours upon hours, I don't think I could withstand the physical demand. 

And research, it just doesn't seem like anything I'm interested in, although I'm starting to feel that it is my best option. I have no background in research whatsoever outside of the lab portion of my classes. I will be looking for a lab to get into this semester as it is an important part of the curriculum for bio at my school. Again the only experience I have is in the lab for class and although I understand that they are not the same, I have hated every minute of the labs I have been forced to endure. Collecting samples is mind numbing, figuring out what tools to use and for what purpose for an experiment is honestly way above my head in difficulty and analyzing data is the absolute last thing I ever want to do. 

I took the time last semester to get my EMT license in addition to my normal classes, just because I really like medicine and I wanted a little taste of what it was like. Now, I really have a hard time accepting the idea of a future without a medical career. The notion of being presented with a problem, investigating in order to diagnose and then dividing a plan to treat, all under the premise of not only helping and supporting someone, but providing them with a better life, is exactly the piece of me that I want to give to the world. But, due to the poor metric used measure the capability and understanding of students, I don't think I ever can. Additionally, due to my poor grades, I feel that even if I do put myself into research job, I'll never make the money I need, especially not the money I want, to support myself, a partner, a family, and my mother who needs great financial help.

What can I do?

Edit: I also want to add that the idea of ""starting over"" at a community college is something I have considered but not really an option for me as I pay for school entirely unassisted by my family, through a $15,000 scholarship that ends next year and loans for all the rest. Financial security is extremely important to me and being $100,000 in debt seems to override financial security of any kind unless I somehow become a millionaire.",1578804859.0

In Denmark (where I am from), it takes 13 years to complete school if you want to go to college (10 years of school, and then 3 years of high school).

Then you go to college. If you want to study law, for instance, you study law for three years to get your bachelors, then 2 to get your masters. For these five years, you will study law, and ONLY law. 

It's the same for every other area of study, this was just an example.

However, after watching legally blonde, I have recently been quite confused regarding the US education system. In the movie, the main characters are at law school, but have bachelors in entirely unrelated subjects.

I researched further, and it seems like your undergraduate is basically just a ton of random classes, with little to no relevance to your graduate degree, (which is where you actually learn your craft).

Is this really right? What is the point of spending 4 years becoming ""well rounded"" before actually studying what you need to study? Doesn't that lead to more poorly educated professionals? (Since graduate studies often only are 2-3 years, compared to 5 years of concentrated studies in your field). Doesn't that lead to degrees taking forever?

It gets even weirder when I read that in order to become an economist (like I am studying to be in Denmark), a bachelors degree in economics is often inadequate, and you actually need a bachelors in math. What? How on earth do you navigate this stuff? What do you do if you studied a program in order to get into medical school, or law school, and then get rejected? Is it just ""too bad, enjoy your debt?""

I'm just honestly a bit confused. Have I misunderstood something? It seems absurd. I hope someone can clear it up for me.",1573607543.0

But I would really appreciate any insight from people who‚Äôs in college or have been in college. Thank you! Also, sorry if this post is all over the place. My mind is jumbled since I‚Äôve been thinking about this a lot.

tl;dr: I‚Äôm incredibly torn about college. On one hand, I hate everything about it; but the other, everyone is telling me to go (and I kinda want to).

A little about myself: Im from NYC, currently senior in high school, have not applied to any colleges or financial aids yet, grades are currently suffering due to part time job, and also got left back a year due to me having to work full time to support my family.

Cost is my main concern and the biggest turn off for me. Sure, FASFA and maybe scholarships will help but even then, it‚Äôs not guaranteed that I go debt free. I don‚Äôt want to have a absurd amount of college debt to pay off. The university I want to go cost about 40k (quick google search). That‚Äôs before any financial aids. Should I just abandon that option and look for CUNY or cheaper colleges?

I‚Äôm afraid my major choice (music) will make it hard for me to get a decent job after I graduate. I love music and playing music. I want to study music theory and become a proper musician. However, I‚Äôm uncertain about this and I have my own doubts in my abilities too. I don‚Äôt want to invest in college and end up wasting my money and time. My main goal is to get a job I love (music) and also earn good money.

In general, I‚Äôm just wondering if it‚Äôs the right move to make. My teachers tell me it‚Äôll open up more doors and potential to earn more money. However, I have a lot on my plate, having to work and pay the bills for my family. School and work is honestly stressing me out a lot. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm ready for college. Even if I do go for music, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôll end up as a waste since music isn‚Äôt a very profitable field(not sure how true that is). 

At the end of the day, I just wanna earn lots of money and save it all up and retire peacefully. Not sure if college is the right move to help me do that.

From my personal experience and statistically, the majority of people between the 18-21/24 age range either don't really know what they want or if they do graduate,  change careers within 5 years or realize what they went to school for is not what they really want to do.

I think, especially with America, we're too focused on trying to be the absolute best and look like we have everything figured out as early as possible that we push our children to basically have their whole life mapped before they even matured completely physically or mentally. I also think it might be left over from the days where travel was limited and it was pretty much taked for granted that you were just gonna do what your parents or previous generations before you were gonna do.

I graduated with a B.S. in IT and was able to move to a place I love and I'm earning a living wage. I have upward movement in my career and I think it was a smart move.I turned 27 this month and for the first time in my life I can afford to be independent.

So those are all good things, but I knew halfway into my B.S. that I wasn't passionate about IT. Sure I find it interesting, but at the same time it feels ""souless"" to me. It doesnt check that passionate box, but I know work doesnt necessarily have to. I feel like my brain gets IT, but I dont ""feel"" it. So it naturally it seemed easier to me then other careers. I also am already sick of sitting all day.

About two years ago I become interested in Environmental science and GIS work. GIS still involves tech so I have been interested in pursuing that. I finished my degree because I wanted out of the financial situation I was in.

I am conflicted because going back to school part-time would take years and by the time I'd graduate I would have had many opportunities to make more money in IT. I know that the company I work for will continuously allow me to move up and expect me too. Also, Neither GIS work or environmental science will pay as much as IT. After graduating I would probably have to take a lower paying job and start over again. I feel like I would have to hide my college from my employer, because I imagine they would not want to invest in my as much. They like investing in longterm employees. TBH though, even If I stayed in IT I probably would change jobs in a couple of years anyway, but It's a matter of not wanting them to know that I am not super excited about my work. If they new I was studying to change fields that may not be good for me.

It would be a big sacrifice to go back, but I am worried I would regret not. I am very passionate about the environment and think GIS may be a good fit for me. I have seen some B.S degree that involve environmental science and GIS.

It feels so freeing to be out of college finally, but I knew I was going to face this decision after graduating. I dont necessarily want to wait too long to decide because I think the more I get into IT the harder it will be to get out. I really want to do it, but then apart of me thinks I should rely on things outside of work to fill that passionate box.

Additionally, I apologize for the length here.

Currently, I am a sophomore studying for a finance undergraduate degree, and I genuinely LOVE learning. Learning is what keeps me moving forward; it‚Äôs what drives me into loads and loads of in-depth topics like reading a 55-page article written by a GWU graduate student on a topic none other than Net Working Capital. Or watching a 12+ hour-long series of YouTube videos from Sloan Business School on graduate finance applications when I had a choice to go socialize/do ‚Äútypical early 20s things and meet with friends (I wish I could put friends in the wavy text but whatever). It might come as no surprise the YouTube channels I most frequent for entertainment include Wendover Productions, Veritasium, 3blue1brown, and other well put together channels.

The problem begins with degree requirements that have ZERO purposes in today‚Äôs curriculum for any white-collar working job from my choice of finance to biology or engineering. I am 100% sure this is what I want to do after I graduate, so don‚Äôt give me any of that crap about being well rounded. In today‚Äôs environment, you need specialized knowledge from people who genuinely are motivated to make a change, create something such as an entrepreneurial venture, or invent the next wheel. I am sick and tired of having to take classes that attempt to liberalize my beliefs (which are moderate, but I lean slightly liberal politically). It is NOT imperative to include graduating requirements where I learn about black transgender people in Chad. I really couldn‚Äôt care less. First, how will this help me as a financial analyst or (insert finance-related career here)? It can‚Äôt, and indeed, it is less helpful than a language course like Chinese or Spanish. College so far has done anything and everything except inspire me to be a meaningful contributor to society as it relates to the traditional sense.

Now I wanted to talk about something even worse for the unacademic community ‚Äî textbooks and outdated cookie-cutter assignments that do not relate to learning the material in any such fashion other than by basic name. Today textbook makers want to eliminate the used book market and squeeze every dime out of poor stony-broke students to make more profit. From a finance perspective, this is brilliant, a genius concept in fact. But from a learning perspective, it kills everything, literally everything. The online anti-learning ecosystems that the access code provides forces students to memorize definitions and ideologies written by the textbook makers that are outdated in some cases more than the books.

It‚Äôs terrible enough teaching economics students J Yellen is still fed chair (J Powell is) with outdated material. But when NONE of the assignments makes you THINK for yourself, you are just throwing money at the wall for a piece of paper you paid 100k to state your name and what ‚Äúqualification‚Äù you have obtained. Trust me here when I say this, I can learn most, if not all, of the things necessary to the jobs I WILL be working in finance on my own in 1/4th the time college can teach it to me.

My university has a finance lab with Bloomberg terminals set up, and I came to this university to be able to learn on those, and so far, the most enjoyable and educational moments have been there in that room NOT in a classroom or study setting. The people that I did talk to in that room one who was an HONORS student said he wasn‚Äôt motivated to look for internships/jobs in finance after getting his degree. If that doesn‚Äôt scream shameful, I don‚Äôt know what does. These people are living on another planet; it‚Äôs the 21st century!

Why do I have to get 20k in debt or more for something that will not help me out? Even if I do get a desirable position, I will have to relearn everything because of the way this school teaches. My community college was better than this for crying out loud. Please, someone, revoke this unlearning institution‚Äôs academic accreditation (which is already officially being questioned by the way) before people think this is learning.

Essentially rather than taking a loan, you instead take an agreement to pay some percentage of your future income for a fixed number of years.

Contingencies are that if you are not actively seeking employment, it does not tick the counter. On the other hand, if you are employed and make below a certain amount, you do not pay and the counter is ticking.

He came back with the offer of doing a PhD with him while working part time for his company (basically I would be just doing a PhD and he would get to use my work in his company, but I would be paid by his company for doing this). The pay is decent. It is around the same as a full-time job in this region or even slightly more. The thing is, after going a Master's, I could never see myself doing a PhD because my experience as a master's student was awful. My professor was not the greatest supervisor and I never had someone to bounce ideas off of. By the sounds of it, this lab group is the complete opposite to the one I was in. I have talked to a couple of his current PhD students and his postdoc. I like the group and the field of research is interesting. The degree would either be in Systems design engineering or biomedical engineering. The one thing is that I am not sure if I feel committed to spending another 4-5 years in school or this region. I did my undergrad and master's at the same university and had every intent to move out west (either US or Canada). 

With the way the economy is now, I'm not sure when I'll be getting interviews again or when jobs will be available. We don't know how long all of this is going to last. The prof has giving me time to think about it. I think he has 2 positions and has offered this to 4 people. I'm definitely confused. I know that if I was offered a job today, I would take it over doing a PhD. (Or at least I think I would... But I seem to be confusing myself more and more over what the right choice is!)

Any advice is welcome! I have talked to many people but a lot of them have not put themselves through grad school to know what the pain can be like!",1587979812.0
2,2,Advice Needed: PhD at a Top Public University vs M.A. at an Ivy League School,0,gbxzuz,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/gbxzuz/advice_needed_phd_at_a_top_public_university_vs/,7,"I embarked on my journey to further my graduate academic career this year, and applied to several (six schools in total) doctoral programs. Out of the six programs, I only got into one PhD at a great public university. However, while one of the Ivy League schools that I applied to did not admit me into the PhD program, they did admit me into one of their M.A. programs. It has always been a dream of mine to study at an Ivy League school, and this is finally my chance to do so. However, I already have two previous Master's degrees, and a ton of student loan debt. I already accepted the spot at the PhD program at the public university back in March; however, the admissions from the Ivy came earlier this week. This change in events has made me rethink my academic career path, and I wanted to reach out to this wonderful community for some advice. The way I see things, below are some pros and cons for both options:

1) PhD Program at Top-10 Public University

a) Pros: No tuition payment; great benefits and a reasonable stipend; get to embark on my PhD journey this year instead of waiting another two years; get to work on interesting and original research right away; school is close to home so I would be able to visit family frequently; cost of living is much lower than at the town where the Ivy is located.

b) Cons: Terminal degree (meaning that my dream of studying at an Ivy would not happen); focus of the program is more local than global in nature; faculty are young and not as established as the Ivy faculty at the program.

2) M.A. Program at Ivy League School

a) Pros: Get to fulfill dream of studying at an Ivy League school; faculty are well established in their respective fields; focus of the program is much more global in nature; cultural activities and centers available at the town where the school is located are innumerable; have some friends in the area (so I will not be completed alone in a new place); access to a strong and well-established alumni network; additional two years to prepare for a PhD program (greater maturity and a better idea of what kind of research to focus my future PhD program dissertation on); opportunity to work as a research assistant during my time at the school.

b) Cons: Extremely high cost of living; need tons of new student loans to afford program; sets me back two years to start my PhD program; would not be as close to family and would be not able to visit them as frequently; diminishing returns of obtaining a third Master's degree.

&#x200B;

Also, my goal is to complete a PhD program, whether it starts this year or two years after the Master's degree. Ultimately, my goal after completing my doctoral studies is to work at an international organization or think tank on climate, sustainability, and natural resource issues.

I welcome your thoughts and feedback!

After speaking with the admissions departments I was told that I would be receiving $0 in stipend or fellowship funding, but one of them told me I would have RA work with a faculty member. The departments have since confirmed that I am on a waitlist for funding, pending offer decisions in the coming weeks. 

The wind was taken out of me upon being told that I wouldn't be receiving funding unless a recipient bails out. I already have an advanced degree so taking out additional debt feels burdensome. I've thought about the option of applying again in the future but I'm relatively disenchanted after the gulag of interviews that resulted in no funding. 

My question is (hopefully) straightforward; is it worth it to enter a PhD program that requires student loans?

I am in my 3rd year of my PhD program in education. I've got 1.5 years left. I have passed my comprehensive exams, which was an incredibly traumatic experience for me. During that month, I had went to urgent care twice and doctors twice and no one knew what was going on with me. Apparently the stress and anxiety was so bad that my body and brain were shutting down. I literally had to force myself to eat after I realized I hadn't ate in days. I could not sleep. I craved alcohol, which I had never craved in my life. I would blackout every time I would try to write my two papers. I had multiple migraines. I was on a plane at one point and hoped that the plane would crash. Multiple times while I was driving, I hoped that I would get into a terrible accident. Anything to escape the torture. These are just a few of the symptoms I was experiencing. I went into it with a very positive and motivated attitude, I was even excited to make it to this milestone, and it just did not end up well for me. This was in September, so about 4 months ago. I actually just pulled up one of my papers, and I legit do not remember writing ANY of it. It is like I was in a complete blackout. Now, I am really struggling to write my proposal. My advisor even said I have a really cool study, something that no one has done before, but every time I try to sit down and read or write, it is like my mind goes blank and I can't get anything done. I have thought about quitting and going into real estate investment, and I have a pretty good opportunity where I could make a lot, much more than the PhD, and that is probably playing into the motivation factor a little - but I was also experiencing the same thing with my coursework last semester after passing my comps, before real estate had entered the picture. The kicker is that I have a government-funded Leadership Grant - which I was funded for a year and a half, totaling at 54k, which would go on top of another big chunk of student loans (I have ZERO debt outside of student loans). I think that I could do very well in real estate, but it is so daunting to think of that 54k turning into a loan. I have to work full time for 36 months to complete my service obligation after I graduate. So I would be stuck in this field for another 4.5 years. I am passionate about what I am studying, but I see all of the academics I work under almost working like slaves - some 80 hours a week, most not happy, overly stressed, and that is something I have no desire to do or experience. I do not enjoy reading or writing, and I have come to enjoy it less and less as time goes on. I have ADHD pretty bad, so the reading and writing is just very difficult for me and my anxiety doesn't make it any better. I am just wondering if anyone out there has or knows anyone who has quit their program with funding that they had turned into loans. If they are happy now, or if it was a terrible decision.  I am starting an intensive therapy this week, 5 days a week for 3 months to try to work through this PTSD and get motivated. I just kind of feel like a failure. I have about 2 pages of my proposal written and I keep feeling like I JUST CAN'T DO IT. sigh. I don't know if it would be possible to claim disability from PTSD and get out of paying that grant back? I dunno. I'm looking for any kind of advice or direction here. I am trying to shift my perspective and now look at school as my part-time job and income (I am now a graduate research assistant - which I would not have to pay back any of that funding I have received if I were to quit) as I work up in the real estate land, but even with this perspective, I'm still getting this ""blackout"" and complete confusion when I sit down to work/read/write.",1578484727.0
7,7,Cornered,6,djrwrb,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/djrwrb/cornered/,8,"I am 32 years old and in the middle of the fifth year of my PhD program (sort of both biological sciences and engineering). This is my second attempt at a PhD. The first was a similar program from 2009 to 2011, which I left. I have not published anything. I have not presented at any conferences. I do not have any data that is worthwhile or meaningful. I have not taken the qualifying exam or formed a committee yet. I have seen my advisor maybe once per year.

Obviously, what I am attempting to do is not appropriate for my abilities, but every career/aptitude/personality test I have taken points to research in biological sciences as a good fit for me, and I intuitively feel that's right.

Nevertheless, my dismissal from the graduate school seems imminent. Even though no one's ever said anything to me about it, I am surprised it hasn't happened yet. Part of me would be relieved at first. I have completed two bachelor's degrees and a ""consolation prize"" master's degree (from the first PhD attempt). In the process I have built up about $155,000 in debt. But I have no work experience apart from the two PhD student gigs and have no idea where I would go. The idea of getting any job with my depression and anxiety seems impossible. And I don't think I could take a so-called menial job with no qualifications just to get by and then face my family after so many years in school and so much debt. I would rather die.

For most of my PhD I have been commuting a distance of 80 miles per day (so about 160 miles round trip), usually seven days per week. I cannot move closer because I cannot leave my mother alone. She has many health problems including dementia.

&#x200B;

I completed my electrical engineering PhD six years ago and have since been employed as a research scientist at a federal lab (US).  My primary area of research has experienced significant funding reductions in recent years, and I'd say the work in general has felt less rewarding.  As a result, I have been working to apply my capabilities to frontier areas of research.  Perhaps the most compelling area of overlap is related to biosensors and biocompatible electronics.  I have a strong background on the electronics side, but very basic understanding of the biological side.  Still, I find that in performing literature reviews on these new (to me) topics, it inspires the excitement that I had previously felt for my primary area of research.

&#x200B;

I found that a local and rather renowned biomedical engineering program offers fully online masters degrees for working professionals.  I found a fellowship through my work that would pay for the degree.  I really like the idea of going through this program at a pace of 1-2 classes per semester while continuing to work full time.  I think it would be a great opportunity to learn about the ""other side"" of the field I am presently working my way into.  The problem is that as part of the fellowship, I would be required to continue working for my employer for 3x the time it takes to complete my degree once it is finished.  If I take it slow at 1-2 classes per semester, this would essentially require me to stay with my present employer beyond 2035!  I don't like the idea of going into debt, or being tied to a long-term employment contract.  The fellowship would also provide me the flexibility to work as little as 24 hours per week while still getting full salary, and so I could go for a more aggressive class schedule to reduce my post-graduation service time, but I am not so keen on cutting back my work hours so dramatically as I feel it could hurt my present career research activities.

&#x200B;

My questions for the community are therefore: 1) Have any of you done something similar and if so, how did you like it? 2) Any experience with leaving a job that paid for your education prior to the contractual term of service, and were you able to convince your new employer to pay off your remaining balance?

I'm someone that really loves learning new things, and I realize I can do a lot of learning on my own, but I think there could be significant value in learning the field through a proper educational framework.",1553984235.0
12,12,Self-sabotage vent,13,9iatiy,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/9iatiy/selfsabotage_vent/,11,"Hi guys,

I recently posted about comps under another name, and I can't remember what it was.  I had failed comps in my first Ph.D. program 10-15 years ago and opted to master out because the departmental politics were out of hand, my advisor had left the university, and my new advisor didn't know how to protect students from the other faculty.  I was one of a few students brought in by a chair who was despised by some of the faculty, and they made it their mission to drive us out.  I left thinking that I could always enroll in another program, but I was done with the egos in the ivory tower for the time being.

So, here I am. I have a great job and my wonderful boss encouraged me to get a Ph.D.  I get free tuition in exchange for working full-time, and I'm five years into the program.  Earlier this year I had comps, and I was freaking out because of the baggage from my last experience, but I passed!

My timeline is to defend my proposal in December and then defend my dissertation next fall.  I have a project idea and I'm going to use existing data to shorten my timeline.

I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I tell myself it's two more papers and I'm done.  I may never have to write another paper in my entire life (no TT for me!)

In spite of seeing that light, I, for some reason, am sabotaging myself.  I can't seem to find motivation.  

I know my problems are all first world problems, but I'm **so** exhausted.  I have spent over ten years of my adult life in doctoral programs.  I am trying to do this most recent one while working full time, and my job has been busy and intense.  My long-term relationship ended last year, so I no longer have any help at home.  I have an old dog with incontinence issues who wakes me up at 4-5am every single day including on weekends.  I feel so guilty that I can't spend more time with her in her old age.  

I also have credit card debt due to the aftermath of the split with my ex and came across an opportunity to earn some extra money in my free time, so I've been doing that during every waking moment that I'm not at work or trying to write.  (I know I'm crazy for adding something else to my life, but I want to get my debt paid down to ease my stress.)  I'm lonely, but I've canceled plans with friends because I'm so tired I'd just melt into the wallpaper.  There is no time or energy for dating.

My self-care consists of a 15 minute chiropractic adjustment every two weeks, counseling every two weeks, and trying to get enough sleep (but my dog is sabotaging that.)  I'm in bed by 8 or 9 pm every night.

I think that these next few months are going to be the worst of the worst.  I am more intimidated by defending a proposal than I am defending a dissertation since it seems like you have to be able to answer every question even tangentially related to your project during your proposal, but in the dissertation defense, it's more focused on what you did.

I know I need to push through but I'm having trouble summoning the fortitude to do it.  I think I've got a flare up of imposter syndrome and my exhaustion is making it difficult to stop sabotaging myself.  Right now, I'm sitting in my office and can't seem to make myself write.

I know that delaying my timeline is an option, but I don't want to do that.  I want my life back.  I want to be able to take naps, have real weekends, go to yoga classes, and live like a normal person.  There have been several times where I've felt like I was headed toward a breakdown, so I know that this isn't healthy for me, but all the more reason to embrace my learned helplessness, power through, and get it done.

I'm not sure if this is just a vent or if I'm looking for advice.  I guess if you have any, let me know.

P.S. I have just laid a massive guilt trip upon myself for how much I could have written for school in the time I wrote this.",1537757447.0

I won‚Äôt get into those details, but the intensity of that experience changed me physically and emotionally. I returned to work and the program last fall and have been doing generally okay.

The problem: I don‚Äôt care about my program anymore. I‚Äôm not interested in conferences or publications, and most of what I‚Äôm reading for exam preparation holds no interest. 

My work has been good, and my mentor has had nothing but praise for my being able to function so well despite these burdens. 

I managed to take only two one-semester stop outs. The university won‚Äôt allow another. 

My employer has paid for all coursework so I don‚Äôt have a financial investment or any debt that I‚Äôll need to pay off. 

I already have tenure at a community college and I‚Äôm in the home stretch before retirement, so I‚Äôm not looking for a new career.

I was working on my dissertation topic long before returning to grad school, but had hit a wall and didn‚Äôt know how to move forward ‚Äî that‚Äôs why I returned. If there was a way to work my topic into coursework, I‚Äôd do it, so I have some dissertation chapters done already. Over the course of the program I‚Äôve picked up more languages, taken coursework at other universities to hone very specific skills, and attended summer seminars to gain access to libraries. 

These exams, though, are a chore and I‚Äôm tired of living a life where there‚Äôs always pressure to jump through another hoop. My exam prep is half-assed and I don‚Äôt feel any connection to what I‚Äôm reading. 

Part of it is the readjustment after a hellish couple of years ‚Äî nothing seems important after the long illness and death of a spouse. 

But I'm also trying to decide whether the program is good for my mental and physical health. Research and exam prep are incredibly isolating, which might not be the best thing for me right now. 

SO, I‚Äôm trying to decide if this is just an expected rough patch or if the program is just not a good fit right now. It has its charms and I‚Äôd miss it if we broke up, but maybe this relationship has run its course and it‚Äôs time to walk away.

**TLDR**: *Facing qualifying exams and finding exam prep to be an empty, lonely chore. Life has been difficult for a long time, so is it time to quit the program and do something that would feel more meaningful? Or is this just a common experience that I need to push myself through?*

15,15,Helping PhD graduates find a job,4,7yrug1,PhD,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/7yrug1/helping_phd_graduates_find_a_job/,7,"What I Did to Get a Job in the Worst Economy Since the Great Depression

This article tells you some about my story and about a little trick I did to help me get a job at a good university, a job I still have today. I really think this still applies today, academia or industry. 

Let me tell you a little about myself. I was doing an initial job search near the end of my PhD, which was at the end of 2008 going into 2009. At the time the stock market had plummeted in value, with most companies freezing their hiring processes, or doing major layoffs. This was a bad time overall to find a job. I always did well in school, and excelled in many aspects. I received scholarships, fellowships, and research assistantships and was happily on my way to getting a great job, I thought, even with the gloom of the economy at the time. 

My logic was that as a BS or MS student I already received job offers at prestigious organizations with a decent salary so surely after graduating with my doctorate I was going to get a great job. Wow after some initial searching, I was starting to realize that I may not get the job of your dreams, or even worse no job.

Sure graduating with my doctorate made me an expert in a particular area, but I started to question how valuable my expertise was in the marketplace. Unfortunately I was I‚Äôll prepared for my job search, for the potential disappointments that came along, and for the fierce competition. I had pressing student loan debt and things started to get tight. I‚Äôm the kind of person that even if I have time in front of me, if I don‚Äôt have a plan, panic starts to settle in. 

As a doctoral student I was the opposite of being socially adept and able to connect with those around me. Being good at my field didn‚Äôt necessarily, or completely prepare me, for the competition I was going to face. One thing I learned right away was that the social aspect and communicating my ideas was almost as important as the actual subject, papers, and projects I had worked on. Sure my CV (curriculum vitae) was solid but as long as I was a weirdo I was doomed to never get a decent job. 

So what do I recommend as a starting point for getting some traction on your first job? Call someone, on the phone, not an email, not a text, not a Facebook message. To me, picking up the phone and calling someone gave me so much fear that I could hardly stand it. What would I say, what if they could hear my voice shaking, what if I didn‚Äôt know the answers to their questions? 

To be really honest, none of that mattered much but I made it to be something so big in my head it paralyzed me. But after a few experiences I quickly learned that I needed to connect with someone outside of the interview, know the process before I even set foot on-site, or even before I submitted my application packet. 	

You may ask yourself now, are you serious? This doesn‚Äôt work anymore today. If I call I will only have access to the secretary or the HR person and they will just tell me to apply online anyway. And I agree that you will have to apply online. But what I‚Äôm advising is that you try to get a person to look at your resume first, talk with you, put a voice to the name. This will greatly increase your chances of getting a job. Applying online without human contact can feel like you‚Äôre lost in cyberspace, with most applications going unanswered.  

After I prepared my CV, I starting calling people. But wait who did I call? What the did I say? You can imagine that some conversations didn‚Äôt last long, I wasn‚Äôt able to get a hold of the right person, but in many cases I was able to. I was persistent. 

An important thing to remember is that most of the people you will be calling are fine people that are wanting great candidates that show diligence and persistence. You won‚Äôt be bothering them, most of these folks are receptive to talk (but don‚Äôt take a tremendous amount of their time, they are busy). 

Once I was able to get a hold of a manager, engineer, or scientist that held information about the job I was applying to, I got information about the interview process, information about who was in charge, even some unsolicited interviews. 

One of the keys of this method is to be persistent and find the right person to call. After a few clicks on the web, it is possible to find the phone number of many of the people in charge or that may hire you. Keep in mind that, yes they will ask you to apply online, but I think it is so important to try to talk to someone before applying.  

As a starting point look online, think of someone you met at a recruiting event of the company, even a friend. Call their number and start asking questions. It is so important that you prepare for this conversation. You don‚Äôt want to completely cold call a company, you want to at least familiarize yourself with the purpose of the company, the job description you‚Äôre interested in, what they sell, how big are they, are you a fit at all for the work they do there, where are they located, if they‚Äôre publicly traded how big are they, etc. 

What do you say?: Let me give you a starting point. If you get nervous like me follow the script below, literally read it and fill in the blanks as you go along. Keep in mind, if you get the person‚Äôs administrative assistant ask to speak with them, schedule an appointment to speak with them, or ask if they have any information on who they may recommend that you speak with instead.

I'd love to hear from people who completed their PhD whilst working full time. Or perhaps you're in the middle of it now? Google has thrown up experiences from some folk, but I'd love to know more. 

I'd especially love to hear how you approached your employer to tell them your intentions to take on such a significant project. I'm curious as to how it was perceived and whether there was concern you'd drop the ball in your day job. 

If it matters --  I am established in my career (39 y.o. and director of a department in a multi-national NGO). I have neither kids nor debt, and am financially stable and in a position where I could fund myself through the 5+? years if nothing changed...

It has been 1.5 years since I joined my PhD at a University and I love the kind of research that is happening here and been gaining lot of exposure.

I have recently read about a PhD position and had the urge to apply for it for mainly 2 reasons.

1. It is time bound (3 years)  and more project/objective oriented compared to my current PhD wherein it might take at least another 4.5 years to complete and also the exact topic in which I will work on is not yet defined.

2. The stipend they are offering(2000 EU) is nearly 6 times the stipend I get in my current university (which is around 350 Eu). I have been paying my educational loan that I took from my Masters but I guess it will take at least another 5 years for me to settle this debt. 

The field for which I am applying is in line with my skills and interests and the stipend would really help reduce my financial burden. I have now been called for an interview at this university and I need some tips on answering one particular question which is ""why leave this PhD and join another"". I do not want to take up the financial part and talk more about the field of research. What pros must I cite regarding taking up the PhD position.

Edit : I have already stated in my PhD application that I am currently a PhD student at another University. Also, apologies If am sending bad vibes to other potential/current students about my willingness to switch a position just for monetary reasons.",1494976778.0

In field B, publications don't really matter much in PhD admissions. I was also at a top 10 institution for field B as an undergrad.

I asked him what he could cut out of his life to reduce his spending and he gives me a shrug. 

Being a few years older, I tried to paint a picture for him about how having a large amount of student debt can impact his life financially, later on. Like getting a car or house will be pushed way back if he has to pay down his student loans. Plus, that'll depend on how much he earns WHEN he gets a job (and how long it'll take for him to get one.)

I'm interested to hear from other university/college students. Is his thinking typical? How do other students think about their spending?

Bit of a rant- I have a bachelor degree with honours in environmental science with a minor in chemistry. Went to one of the better universities in my state. The whole time I went to school, profs/deans/course directors would talk at length about all the jobs waiting for you, but holy shit what a lie. After nearly a year of searching I did get a ‚Äútemporary full time‚Äù doing some testing for a municipality 2 hours away (temporarily moved for it). But even that was only 17 dollars an hour with little room for growth and only contract work ( with no prospect of a career).

Im looking at doing a similar graduate degree (political science/international relations + journalism) and  really want to do this abroad - either somewhere in Europe or the US. 

I was recently more drawn to Europe as I would like to do some travelling around the region before a get a FT job and have already travelled quite a bit in the US (and Canada and Central/South America for that matter) however I would love to work in the US in the future at I'm pretty confident a US degree would be much more preferred that a European one, especially in my field. Im also assuming it would be pretty hard to find employment as a non-native speaker unless I studied in the UK, however the main university im considering in Europe is Sciences Po. A actually have a friend (more like acquaintance lol) actually studying a graduate degree there at the moment but im pretty sure his parents are paying for the degree and his rent so im not sure if he actually has/needs a job. So - i'm assuming it would be pretty tough to find a part time job in Paris as a non-French speaker. If anyone could confirm/deny this that would be great. 

My other main draw towards Europe would be its proximity to Geneva which I'm assuming would be beneficial for networking but I have started to doubt this due to the lack of courses I could take near the city and not speaking the language. Im guessing it would be easier and more beneficial to network  and take internships in a place where I could actually do it properly...

So on to the US - a couple years ago it was my ""goal"" to study at NYU - I then learned HOW EXPENSIVE TUITION FEES ARE IN THE US. In Australia you can get your bachelor degree for around $30,000 in total ($20,200 USD), and that price is similar for all the masters degrees I've checked out here too. So going into a heap of debt is not something I'm looking to do. My main draw to NYU was obviously the prime location - especially for my area of study - but I just don't think that I could justify the whole debt thing. Im pretty uneducated about the who US college system thing so I would really appreciate anyones suggestions for colleges in the US that would be a good fit (especially in New York state). 

My lack of answers here leaves me at kind of a dead end; sciences po sounds great and the location seems pretty good but i'm not sure how I would go not speaking French, whereas NYU would be a dream come true and is in the most favourable location but the fees are probably just too much for me to handle.

It takes an HOUR and because it‚Äôs fall it rains everyday- it takes an HOUR & 20 minutes to drive to college and come back. My mom said she would just drive me. How am I going to study,  work or have a social life?

I have an on campus job and it‚Äôs so hard because I have to ask my parents AND my siblings about their schedules to make my work AND class schedule. 
So far I‚Äôve made friends but because I don‚Äôt live in a dorm it‚Äôs hard to really make an actual friend group bc I can‚Äôt hang out whenever. The other day I was invited somewhere but, my mother called me and said she was already waiting for me & I had to go home. I thought I would get over it. 

I thought everyday I would be happier living at home but everyday when they pick me up, I see everyone walking to their dorms with friends and I get kinda sad. For freshman they have a two week long thing and it‚Äôs supposed to be for freshman to meet other freshmen BUT, because I don‚Äôt live on campus I can‚Äôt really go. I mean If i were to go- I‚Äôd have my parents drop me off and I would walk-go to the events alone. Most people go with their roommate bc by then, they get to know each other. I know what you are probably thinking: I‚Äôm ungrateful. 

First, thanks for looking out for my parents but, also try to put yourself in my position:
-it takes 1.20 minutes of commute to and from = 1 hr & 40 minutes‚Äî not counting the times I might spend waiting for my sibling to also get out of work so: 2 HOURS EVERYDAY. TWO.

-yes, I‚Äôve tried to talk to my parents especially my mom. But, she gets mad and sad and she says I hate her and all I want to do is get away from her and then she says I‚Äôll miss her when she‚Äôs dead and how I should be grateful for having a caring mom who wants to help.

-social life? I had my parents pick me up and drive me places in hs but no one does that in college

-STUDYING! My room is across from my parents room. Like literally 2 feet away. My mom doesn‚Äôt go to sleep until she can‚Äôt stay up anymore. During hs it was hard doing homework, studying bc she would check in every now and then and say to go to sleep. I have always wanted to study at night BUT, I couldn‚Äôt bc my mom would yell at me and ask why I couldn‚Äôt do that earlier

-my parents are kinda really strict

-my mom thinks she‚Äôs helping but she‚Äôs not! She‚Äôs making it more annoying and harder than it has to be by offering to be a driver.

- The loans would be in my name if i needed them to help pay for my dorm. And, yeah; living at home means I wouldn‚Äôt have debt but, everyone does it and they are fine.

I don‚Äôt have a vast financial base, I‚Äôm not religious, and I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my damn time. 

Im a 19y female, first semester sophomore at a private Jesuit university in the Midwest. My school is known for ‚Äúbreeding medical students‚Äù and so i came into college with that being my intent on future career choices. I bet you could guess where if you really tried. 

However, now I‚Äôm majoring in Business Intelligence & Analytics (BIA) and Economics.

Let me just say: I‚Äôm fucking MISERABLE here. I tried all of the Greek life sorority shit (cause that‚Äôs the only way you can have a social life here with only 1000 students per graduating class), and I still don‚Äôt have a social life. It seems that everyone‚Äôs priorities are in a different place than mine. I feel this weird social pressure and frankly I feel extremely out of place. I don‚Äôt have many friends but rather a few acquaintances. I work off campus (which is surprisingly rare here) every weekend, don‚Äôt care what i look like going to class, and don‚Äôt care about the extensive CORE classes i have to take that revolve around ‚Äúmaking you a better person through religion.‚Äù 

I just hate it and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I‚Äôm looking at give or take ~50-60k in student loans once I graduate. 

Strengths:
Understanding big picture concepts, talking to people, numbers, working hard

My ultimate goal: 
focus on internships rn, right out of college enroll at Northwestern Uni to receive my MBA. I would say I‚Äôm pretty smart‚Äîmy GPA is not the best from all my pre-med classes (3.0) but overall I‚Äôm a pretty high-achieving individual I would say.

I want to get the best possible education I can in this field so I hope to go University to get a proper education and qualification in this field.

But I live in the UK.

For some reason, every single course showreel or student film I look at seams to be painfully mediocre compared to some of the things I see coming from foreign schools. I want to give myself the best possible chance I could have in Animation but it seems like my choices are limited to getting a less than ideal education or putting myself in heaps more debt than I usually would in the UK by going to a foreign school. I get that animation's not as big of an industry here as other places but I should be able to find something more than the bare minimum, right??

I feel completely lost, I've just started year 13 and I already feel like I'm without any direction to go in from here, does anyone have any advice on what I could do? Any advice at all would be appreciated, please. I don't know what to do.",1537939459.0

As the title indicates, I'm currently a high school senior and I'm really stressed about picking a school/schools to apply to. My ultimate goal is to be a practicing physiotherapist in California (not for the weather, for the amount of pro athletes out there). The thing is, I'm Canadian (living in Canada), so the cheapest choice is to go somewhere local (not to mention, I have a guaranteed $2000 renewable scholarship). Essentially, I can graduate from a Masters of PT program here for about $60 000. But, then I'd have to go through the process of getting my credentials recognized in the States, and doing a t-DPT program. 

However, I could go to a school in the US, do a 6-year combined BS/DPT and be good to go as a practicing PT. That being said, being an international student (at most schools), I'd have about $240 000 in student debt.

I know you guys don't know me, but please, at the very least, let me know what you guys would do in this situation. ",1427221790.0
